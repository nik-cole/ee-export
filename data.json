The carriers we use are checked by our system on a daily basis for compliance. You can feel confident that we won&rsquo;t put your freight in the hands of a noncompliant carrier. Did you know that sometimes, asset-based carriers will broker out your load to another carrier without your knowledge?

Certainly not. Working with us means more peace of mind for you, not less.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOften, shippers will be quick to dismiss the idea of using a \"broker\" because they think it means a loss of control over their shipments. At Trinity, your shipment is under constant watch. Unlike other providers, we are the ones who actually talk to the carriers. We ensure we know the status of the load at all times. That eliminates 80% of the potential problems that can occur when using a 3PL company, and the other 20% is eliminated because of our strict policy that carriers do not make the pickup and delivery appointments for the shipments. We don&#39;t \"hand over\" the load for someone else to monitor - we monitor the load ourselves. Within a few moments, we can discover where your load is at any given time.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe&#39;re consistently ranked one of the top 25 players in our industry every year by Transport Topics. We&#39;re been in operation since 1979 and have the highest regard for both our customers and contracted carriers. We work closely with many large corporations in the United States, like Pizza Blends, Stop &amp; Shop, Kelly Moore, and B&amp;G Foods.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSome shippers really just prefer to work with an asset-based company. It&#39;s true that we don&#39;t have our own trucks and trailers... but we do pride ourselves in the assets we have, like our people and the relationships we&#39;ve forged over time with our network of over 20,000 carriers. Did you know that many asset-based companies often broker out a portion of their customers&#39; freight if they \"run out\" of their own equipment? During truck shortages, when trucks are tight, it&#39;s likely that the actual carrier moving your truckload freight is not the same one you contracted. Also, many carriers limit the states they run to, and are not permitted to run into some areas that you may need. Using a logistics freight solutions provider like Trinity means you can \"have your pick of the litter\" and find any type of equipment for any type of lane you need to run.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\tOf course, due to the bad apples out there, another typical concern about going with a 3PL&nbsp; is getting scammed and having to pay the freight bill twice (once to the broker, and again to the carrier after they don&#39;t receive payment from the broker.) As a logistics provider, we are required to carry a surety bond. By law, we are only required to have a $10,000 bond, but ours is $250,000 - the highest possible. This is the guarantee to the customer and shipper of our responsibility to pay the carrier. Once you pay Trinity, your obligation ends there.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHopefully these factoids help clear your mind and dispel that \"freight broker\" myth.

Now is the time to brush up on the basics of getting some of those items across the U.S. border and to their final destinations. Here are the top five things to remember when shipping items in and out of Mexico.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Verify the complete addresses.<\/strong>&nbsp;We have a habit of assuming we know what city people are talking about, based upon our own experiences. The reality is that there are multiple places in the U.S. with the same city names. The same is true for Mexico, and therefore, to provide accurate pricing and routing, it&rsquo;s critical that we verify the complete addresses on both ends. Here is a sample of what an address in Mexico should look like:<br \/>\n\t\t<br \/>\n\t\tAutopista Mex-Qro KM 41.5 Nave 3<br \/>\n\t\tCuautitlan Izcalli Edo De Mexico C.P. 54715<br \/>\n\t\t&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Know the details.<\/strong>&nbsp;The smallest measurement could change everything. We need to know the exact shipping commodity, pallet count, piece count, weight, temperature, load value, and the type of equipment. For example, the product could be dry, but it may need to be protected from extreme temperatures during the summer. If we know the specifics, we could suggest using a reefer without actually turning the unit on in an effort to minimize the impact. It&rsquo;s better to have too much information than not enough.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Is it able to be transloaded?<\/strong>&nbsp;While there are a few carriers who can drive straight across the border, it&rsquo;s still not the norm. Many customs brokers have large warehouses at the border where we can transload product between carriers. Surprisingly, this often saves our customers money.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Do you have a Customs Broker?<\/strong>&nbsp;This is mandatory for any load crossing the border. Most of the time, your buyer will have a customs broker that they use regularly. However, those who are new to shipping in and out of Mexico may not. We know how valuable an experienced customs broker is, and we can provide one for you. A good customs broker can usually get shipments &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; in less than 48 hours. This is extremely important to know ahead of time if your loads are time sensitive.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<strong>Freight on the Mexico side of the border is not insured<\/strong>. Currently, if your freight needs insurance protection, you have to purchase an insurance policy just for that shipment. This causes headaches for many of our customers. Theft is a large problem in Mexico, and therefore, it pays to use carriers and brokers that have solid relationships on both sides of the border.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\n\tAs we continue to help you with your everyday transportation needs, consider allowing us to partner with you on your Mexico freight, too. We have plenty of experience and are willing to help you with the transition. You can be sure our number one priority is to provide you with great service as we focus on the details so that you don&rsquo;t have to.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"156","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"More Than Just \"Booking Loads\"","url_title":"more-than-just-booking-loads","entry_date":"1368553440","exerpt":"Chris McAvoy, Director of Operations of our Design Solutions team, describes the similarities between the growth of Amazon.com and Trinity's business model.

This critical aspect of the logistics industry is something that not only affects domestic freight professionals, as it also extends to international shipping. The first step of precaution we advise our shippers to take is to be knowledgeable and understand how the HOS regulation can and will impact your transportation processes.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tThe Change<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tThe most critical element of the regulation is the provision limiting the minimum on 34-hour restarts. In the final ruling, drivers must include periods in those two nights between 1-5a.m. as home terminal time, and this may only be used once per week. They drive their daily 11 hours, but are capped weekly at 60\/70 hours before they need to take the 34 hours of down time to restart their weekly clock.&nbsp; An additional factor involves the mandatory rest breaks of at least 30 minutes every 8 hours. There are numerous ways the final ruling impacts the shipping world, here are a few major ones:<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">Delayed deliveries:<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\"> Due to the reduction in the amount of time a driver is able to operate, it will inevitably take longer to transport shipments, resulting in delivery delays to your customers and potentially even a loss of business. For just-in-time manufacturers that have operated with lean inventories and small delivery windows, it can affect the inbound timing of those very important deliveries that supply production lines.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">Increased costs: <\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">In order to continue supporting their customer base, trucking companies will be forced to pay current drivers more, add additional drivers, and add trucks to offset the decrease in available hours per driver. Some carriers estimate the impact on their revenues could be up to a 33% hit. The additional operating costs associated, estimated between $10-25,000 per truck, will undoubtedly be passed along to the shippers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">Reduced availability: <\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">Many trucking companies will be unable to keep up with the need for increased equipment, and will be unable to expand their fleets to service their existing customer base. Recent changes to trucking compliance regulations already put a dent in the available pool of decent truck drivers with a safe record, and the best drivers are going to the companies with the best pay and benefits package. Fewer available trucks will lead many carriers to unethical business practices such as juggling shipments beyond acceptable pickup date ranges and making empty promises to their customers. Shippers will need to have increased accessibility to additional partners with proven strong service records.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">Reconfigured Routing:<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\"> Shippers may need to adjust and rework their usual shipping schedules and loading process to accommodate the changes in the hours-of-service within acceptable delivery appointment windows. Warehouses often have stringent acceptable time frames for inbound orders, which can affect the ability of the driver to offload the order and move on to their next load. To avoid increased days of transit and costs, shippers will often need to reconfigure the way they route many routine shipments or work with their customers on looser delivery windows.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">Trinity Logistics is poised and prepared to help counteract the effects of the HOS ruling on your supply chain.

But what happens when that source of inspiration comes from tiny fingers and toes and is suddenly a part of your family? According to Trinity team member Gayla Altman, &ldquo;You just embrace it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHer son, Josh Altman, has Down Syndrome - a genetic condition in which a person is born with an extra chromosome. While Down Syndrome can cause development issues, this hasn&rsquo;t stopped Josh for one moment. He&rsquo;s grown into a man who&rsquo;s not only beating the odds of his condition, but is challenging others to do the same. Josh graduated with his class, holds a job, volunteers, and regularly competes in Special Olympics. Of the sixteen sports he participates in, his mom coaches eight of them. His athletic abilities have given him the opportunity to travel around the world and bring home more sports medals than the rest of us can probably account for. According to Gayla, there is a rod going across a wall of his room full of medals, shelves behind them filled with trophies, and that doesn&rsquo;t begin to include what she&rsquo;s managed to store away in boxes. When Josh was asked if he was ready for his latest volleyball tournament, he said, &ldquo;Oh, yeah! I&rsquo;m ready to win.&rdquo; As it turned out, he took home yet another bronze medal. His gold medals from last month&rsquo;s powerlifting competition hadn&rsquo;t even had time to collect dust.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Gayla joined our Trinity family earlier this year, Josh joined us too. He comes to the Texas office a couple times a week and it&rsquo;s clear his purpose is to make us smile. He quickly broke down barriers and managed to find his place with the rest of us. His fingers and toes have grown, but his ability to touch our hearts is still holding strong. So what&rsquo;s the next step? What do we do to reciprocate the impact he is making on our lives?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the things Josh does is speak to others about special needs and help people get aware. Let&rsquo;s take a moment to listen and get educated by researching Special Olympics (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.specialolympics.org\">www.specialolympics.org<\/a>) and other local organizations like Special Needs Assistance Partners (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ntxsnap.org\">www.ntxsnap.org<\/a>) that not only support our communities, but members of our own family. Let&rsquo;s adapt to the curve balls thrown at us like they did. We all have our comfort zones, but the greatest thrills and stories in life are found outside the circle we create for ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Gayla, &ldquo;We will never turn away a volunteer, even if it&rsquo;s just for ten minutes.&rdquo; If you happen to see Josh, ask him if he&rsquo;d like someone to go watch him at his next basketball game. His wide eyed smile will confirm that simply taking a few minutes out of your day can make a huge difference in the life of another.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"167","cat_name":"Carriers","title":"Heart Healthy Facts for Drivers","url_title":"heart-healthy-facts-for-drivers","entry_date":"1359579540","exerpt":" According to the American Heart Association every American has at least one risk factor for heart disease.

In today&rsquo;s business environment, companies and their customers want instant tracking capabilities across the supply chain. Our system provides that. Accounting and salespeople in your organization could benefit heavily from easily accessible reports that show your freight spend by carrier, lane, product line, or SKU number. That would provide them with the information they need to accurately and competitively price your own products in your marketplace. The TMS also allows you to more accurately measure carrier performance and hold your carriers accountable.<\/p>\n\n<h3>&ldquo;Automating our process would put me out of a job!&rdquo;<\/h3>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\n<p>Actually, one of the best things about using transportation management software is that it puts all of the control into your hands.

The reports will show how much money the company is saving, along with improved carrier performances, to demonstrate how you&rsquo;ve enhanced your supply chain while simultaneously controlling costs. Further, by automating some of your manual processes, you&rsquo;ll personally be able to take on new and perhaps more important projects, challenges, or other areas to improve.<\/p>\n\n<h3>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve looked into it already, and it&rsquo;s too expensive.&rdquo;<\/h3>\n\n<p>Some systems comparable to Trinity&rsquo;s TMS cost up to $10,000 monthly for implementation, in addition to transaction fees.

Your competitors are investing in technology like this right now to help them stand out. It could be a big gamble to take a chance, waiting a year or two before implementing a TMS yourself.

Every now and then, we like to take a time-out from our regular content and spotlight one of Trinity&rsquo;s stellar sales reps. This week, we&rsquo;re featuring John Park, a big-hearted Texan with tons of logistics experience and a Southern drawl that could win anybody over. Check out the questions we asked him below.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tHow long have you been with Trinity, and how did you end up here?<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;ve been with Trinity for about five years. Chris Shaw, the VP of Operations at Trinity&rsquo;s Texas office, worked with me at another logistics company. In 2008, we both left there to start up the Texas office. We started out with only five people in the office, and now we&rsquo;re up to 30 or so. We also just moved into a brand new, much roomier office here in the Dallas area.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tWhat has been your favorite thing about working at Trinity?<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tProbably all the support we get from the corporate office, whether it&rsquo;s credit, collections, billing, marketing&hellip; they&rsquo;re a really professional team that backs you up no matter what, and that means a lot to me. It&rsquo;s good to be with an organization that is as serious about the business as we are. You don&rsquo;t have to chase anyone around to get stuff done, and there&rsquo;s tons of support from the corporate level. Also, our good reputation makes it really easy for me to find carriers to work with.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tSo&hellip; it would appear that you got pied in the face.<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tSure did! Our office is a huge supporter of the Angelheart Kids organization, so we&rsquo;re very involved with the children they have in foster care. Last year, we had a Christmas party for them, and we wanted it to be even bigger and better this year, so we had a bunch of fundraisers to raise money for the party. We had jars lined up in the office with people&rsquo;s names on them, and whoever ended up with the most money in their jar would get pied. Well, I won, and Gayla, one of the other Texas office team members, ended up doing the honor. I told her to take it easy, but she slammed that thing right in my face&hellip; and it was half frozen. Plus it was outside &ndash; in the wintertime. At least it was lemon meringue!<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tWhat&rsquo;s something interesting about you that most people don&rsquo;t know?<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tI was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was 2 years old, and it&rsquo;s something that really impacted my life. Despite my struggles in school growing up, I was able to complete a four-year bachelor&rsquo;s degree in just three years, and I was immediately selected for a competitive management training program with Yellow Freight right out of college.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tWhat&rsquo;s the first thing you think your customers notice about you?<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tThe first thing they always notice is that I follow up a lot. I&rsquo;m really conscious about making sure everything gets done right. They always tell me I follow up better than anybody else in the industry and I&rsquo;m on my game. One customer wanted me to come give a speech to their salespeople about integrity and customer service and follow-up, so that was awesome.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\tWhat do you think separates Trinity from our competitors?<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tI would say the quality of the people that we have working here. If you have quality people, your company will shine. The character and integrity of our people and the passion we have for our jobs is what really makes us stand out.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you&rsquo;d like to get in touch with John, you can reach him by phone at <strong>(817) 359-2502<\/strong> or <a href=\"http:\/\/john.park@trinitylogistics.com\">john.park@trinitylogistics.com<\/a>.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"171","cat_name":"LTL","title":"The Docket Watchers: How Trinity Can Help You Avoid LTL Cost Creep","url_title":"how-trinity-can-help-you-avoid-ltl-cost-creep","entry_date":"1358200080","exerpt":"Have you ever been approached for information about your LTL (less-than-truckload) shipping practices by a group called the NMFTA?

This group maintains and publishes the National Motor Freight Classification, better known as the NMFC, which contains classifications for commodities shipped by LTL carriers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs you probably know, the classification assigned to a product has a bearing on how much it will cost to ship it. You may not know that the <strong>NMFTA (National Motor Freight Traffic Association)<\/strong> also reviews and votes on classification changes of commodities using guidelines for density, handling, stowability and liability characteristics of the commodity. Carriers are also involved; in fact, they reach out to the NMFTA with ideas, data, and possible commodities to review at their meetings, which are now held only a few times per year.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAt any given time, the <strong>CCSB (Commodity Classification Standards Board)<\/strong> has a list of projects they&#39;re in the process of researching. Without a doubt, the commodities and classes being researched almost always end up in higher classifications, which result in LTL carriers increasing their prices on those shipment types.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs a logistics freight solutions provider and a top logistics company in our industry, Trinity Logistics takes the time to educate our customers when those research projects may involve commodities you routinely ship. By giving the advance heads up, we&#39;re able to help create strategies to help the manufacturers and distributors of products within those research projects mitigate possible risks, including cost creep.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe best way Trinity Logistics can assist in avoiding cost creep is to help our shippers get ahead of the decision. By giving us a Letter of Authorization, shippers that may be affected can leverage our expertise negotiating with LTL carriers to work out possible FAK (Freight All Kinds) rates. Putting customer-specific pricing agreements into place ahead of time can avoid the classification change and, thus, likely the increased pricing.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAlso, simply having the knowledge of the upcoming meetings and topics can be something a manufacturer can promote within their own industry associations to lodge a public amendment suggestion, and we can rally on their behalf with the NMFTA. We are proactive in letting our customers know about potential upcoming changes that affect their business, and offer any assistance we can provide to help mitigate or prevent changes from resulting in increased transportation costs.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNot all research projects end up on the docket for review and vote in the CCSB Public Meetings, such as the one scheduled for January 29, 2013. A docket is generally released closer to the date of the meeting to allow for proposed amendments to be considered during the meeting. It also provides notice of classification changes made necessary by law, by order a regulatory body or for clarification. These are available without charge on www.nmfta.org. If you are a shipper that manufactures, distributes or ships one of the commodities on the list of research projects or on an upcoming docket, expect us to give you a call and let you know how we can help.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"172","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Five Reasons You Should Be Shipping Intermodal","url_title":"five-reasons-you-should-be-shipping-intermodal","entry_date":"1357564080","exerpt":"Many businesses immediately brush off the idea of rail shipments without much consideration, but often this decision is based on outdated knowledge and a misunderstanding of the industry. By not checking out this option, you could be seriously missing out! Below, we've detailed (short and sweet) the top five reasons you should be considering intermodal shipping.","content":"<p>Many businesses immediately brush off the idea of rail shipments without much consideration, but often this decision is based on outdated knowledge and a misunderstanding of the industry. By not checking out this option, you could be seriously missing out! Below, we&#39;ve detailed (short and sweet) the top five reasons you should be considering intermodal shipping.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1) Cost-effectiveness. <\/strong>This is the most widely-known benefit of intermodal shipping -- it&#39;s usually cheaper than shipping truckload. Who doesn&#39;t like to save money?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2) Extra capacity.<\/strong> When trucks are hard to come by, the railway might be wide open. The intermodal industry continues to add new 53&#39; containers to their fleets, while many trucking companies are being forced out of business due to the economy. An freight solutions provider like Trinity can tap into this extra capacity and save your freight from sitting on the dock for days, waiting for a truck to become available during tight seasonal periods, like produce season.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>3) Inclement weather? Who cares?<\/strong> Rail carriers will generally keep on rolling during inclement weather conditions, whereas highways tend to be shut down or slowed down, bringing your truckload freight to a halt. This is especially relevant right now, as we are starting to see major snowfall impacting certain regions this winter season.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>4)<\/strong> <strong>It&#39;s good for the environment.<\/strong> An intermodal train will emit 6.8 pounds of carbon emissions for every 100 ton miles, compared to an over-the-road truck emitting 19.8 pounds. That same intermodal train can move one ton of freight intermodal for approximately 830 miles on only one single gallon of diesel fuel! If your company has a green initiative, this switch could be highly beneficial for you.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>5)<\/strong> <strong>Convenience.<\/strong> We stay in touch with the draymen when they&#39;re picking up and delivering your freight, and we have access to real-time electronic tracking from pickup to delivery, increasing visibility. You don&#39;t have to worry about much - if there&#39;s a problem, we&#39;ll work it out.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sounds enticing, huh?

That would be Peter Callagy, a member of Trinity&#39;s Business Development team at our Kansas City office. We recently sat down with Peter and asked him a few questions. Read on to find out about his Tough Mudder experience and more!<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t1. How long have you been with Trinity, and how did you end up here?<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;ve been with Trinity for two and a half years now. I was actually contacted by a recruiter at my alma mater, Central Missouri State, and encouraged to check out our Kansas City office. At the time, I was working in sales at a different company, in the first aid &amp; safety industry. Trinity seemed like a great opportunity and I&rsquo;m obviously glad I took it.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t2. What has been your favorite thing about working at Trinity?<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tProbably just the family atmosphere here. Everybody looks to support each other and support every aspect of the company, and I think that&rsquo;s hard to come by.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t3. So it looks like you recently got a little muddy&hellip;<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tI recently ran the Tough Mudder, an 11.5 mile obstacle course event that raises money for the Wounded Warrior Project, which provides support to soldiers coming back from overseas. It was pretty crazy &ndash; there was wall climbing, jumping off 15-foot platforms into ice-cold water, actually going through ice-filled water, climbing hills, crawling through mud&hellip; it&rsquo;s similar to a basic training obstacle course. It took us about four hours. My neighbor told me about the event, and I had been interested in doing the Warrior Dash and similar, shorter events, but I dove right in and tackled the most intense race first.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t4. What&rsquo;s something interesting about you that most people don&rsquo;t know?<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tI ride motorcycles. I&rsquo;ve done that for about ten years. That surprises a lot of people. I was thinking about growing out a beard and wearing cut-off jean jackets to fit the bill a little better, but I don&rsquo;t think that would look very good on the job. I&rsquo;ve also never had a cavity! Most people don&rsquo;t know that, but it&rsquo;s also not very interesting&hellip;<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t5. What&rsquo;s the first thing you think your customers notice about you?<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tDefinitely my dedication to customer service, I would say. My number one focus is solving the problem for the customer, whether it&rsquo;s just moving your standard load of freight, or getting them information on LTL or another service they aren&rsquo;t familiar with. I&rsquo;m very customer-focused, rather than rate- or profit-focused.<\/p>\n<h4>\n\t6. What do you think separates Trinity from our competitors?<\/h4>\n<p>\n\tAgain, probably customer service. We are that company that tries their hardest to get the shipment moved no matter what and problems solved no matter what, whether it&rsquo;s a big customer or small customer. I also think the family atmosphere I mentioned earlier really shines through to the customer, and it also helps us build really close relationships with customers who value that similar close-knit and supportive environment in their business.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you&#39;d like to get in touch with Peter, you can email him by clicking <a href=\"http:\/\/peter.callagy@trinitylogistics.com\">here<\/a>!<\/p>"}, {"ID":"175","cat_name":"Company Culture","title":"Our Culture: Top 3 Video Submissions","url_title":"our-culture-top-3-video-submissions","entry_date":"1355233380","exerpt":"Though Trinity Logistics employees work arduously, they still make time to have a little fun!

Sometimes, if a carrier refuses to pay for a claim, the shipper will have to take legal action.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs a service to our customers, Trinity will assist with filing any claims that arise when we have arranged the transportation of a shipment. Although we do offer to help file the claim for the customer, we are not legally liable for the loss of cargo.&nbsp; We essentially act as the liaison between the customer and the carrier that moved their freight. We collect all the paperwork from the customer and submit it to the carrier (or their insurance, depending on the amount of the claim) on their behalf. We have four full-time employees at our corporate office who are dedicated to offering this service to our customers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tYou might be surprised at just how sticky and complicated claims can be. For example: many carriers have exceptions for electronics on their insurance policy. Because electronics are so expensive, the insurance company will explicitly exclude them from their policy in order to avoid being liable for loss or damages to that product. For this reason, Trinity will <strong>not<\/strong> knowingly book a load of electronics with a carrier whose insurance company has excluded electronics from their coverage. This is why it&rsquo;s imperative for our customers to know exactly what they&rsquo;re shipping so they can relay that information to us and we can accurately select a carrier with the correct insurance in order to prevent complications if a claim happened to arise.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSometimes, it&rsquo;s simply not black and white. A carrier traveling in high winds that gets in an accident could claim it was due to an &ldquo;act of God&rdquo; and dismiss their liability, but what if they were warned of the winds and chose to carry on? What about a carrier whose trailer is seized by the government, putting the freight in embargo? What if the temperature of a reefer wasn&rsquo;t maintained and the product spoiled &ndash; but there&rsquo;s no way to check what the temperature of the unit was during transit? Is the carrier really at fault? These are tricky situations, but luckily, we have the expertise to help our customers through the process of filing a claim.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDon&rsquo;t get stuck with the responsibility of dealing with complicated claims &ndash; start using Trinity&rsquo;s services and we&rsquo;ll be there to help you take care of it.

No amount of information is too much information. You should always be sharing what the load consists of, the number of pallets, and most importantly, the weight. When determining the weight of your shipment, it&rsquo;s imperative to ensure that information is as accurate as humanly possible. Usually, you&rsquo;ll get about 2,000 pounds of wiggle room, but if there&rsquo;s a discrepancy larger than that &ndash; particularly, if the load is heavier than you claimed &ndash; the carrier will charge you, because the they will be using more fuel to transport your freight than originally planned. This upgrade in price will likely cost you more than if you had just provided an accurate weight at the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2) Be ready. <\/strong>Make sure your truckload freight is ready to be loaded as soon as the driver arrives. If it&rsquo;s not, you risk paying detention fees for the time the driver has to sit around waiting for you. Similarly, if you can, ensure that the receiving location of your shipment is ready for the driver to unload your freight upon arrival, and that they know when the driver will be arriving. If not, again, you could get slammed with detention fees (and there is no set hourly rate &ndash; depending on the consequences of his or her wait, a driver can charge you for however much he or she deems fit!)<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3) Be honest.<\/strong> If there&rsquo;s no one there to unload at your receiving location and the driver has to unload your truckload shipment himself &ndash; or even touch it at all &ndash; it will generally cost more. This is inevitable. However,&nbsp; it&rsquo;s vital that you make sure to tell the driver he will have to touch it beforehand. If he doesn&rsquo;t know and it&rsquo;s a surprise to him when he arrives, you will likely be charged much more for this additional service than if you had indicated it was necessary up-front.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4) Be flexible.<\/strong> Know the days that your truckload shipment absolutely must pick up by and absolutely must deliver by. If you can be flexible on the pick-up day, as long as your shipment still delivers on the same day, you may be able to save money. Additionally, if you are able to book a shipment some days in advance, it will likely be far less expensive than booking it on the same day. Giving it some lead time means there&rsquo;s more capacity at the time you book the shipment and rates will usually be lower.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\t<strong>5) Offer volume.<\/strong> If you offer 20 shipments a month to a carrier or broker, you&rsquo;ll probably get lower overall rates than if you offer one shipment, one time only. If you don&rsquo;t have much volume to offer, working with Trinity allows you to leverage our volume and take advantage of the lower rates we can obtain through those means.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>6) Know the value.<\/strong> Be cognizant of the value of your shipment. Most carriers have insurance for up to $100,000, so if it&rsquo;s below that, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. But if the value is higher than that, you will likely have a smaller selection of carriers to choose from who are able to carry that level of insurance, plus you may have to pay more for them to seek out special insurance for that particular load. Be aware that shipping such high-value loads could mean more expense for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBy putting these easy practices into place, you can save loads (no pun intended) of money! Print out this blog, make a checklist, or run through a list of mental reminders every time you book a load, and be sure to share this post with anyone you know who ships a lot of truckload freight.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhether truckload freight is a huge aspect of your business or you only ship a few loads per month, Trinity can help you with your transportation needs.

Alarmingly, the article shares that particular carrier has had safety issues in the past, breaking regulations and getting in trouble for falsifying their logs. Your eyes widen in horror when you see the name of the carrier. You just booked a load with them last week! How could you have unknowingly used a carrier with such unsafe practices?<\/p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, this isn&rsquo;t just hypothetical &ndash; the story above is real, although we&rsquo;ve omitted the specifics. This case didn&rsquo;t involve us, thank goodness &ndash; but what if that shipper was you? Many shippers have neither the time nor resources to do thorough background checks on carriers, making sure their insurance isn&rsquo;t expired, their safety ratings are good, they haven&rsquo;t broken federal regulations, and they don&rsquo;t have a bad reputation in the industry. By taking these risks and blindly handing over your freight to a questionable carrier, your chances of running into serious (and expensive) problems are high. What if your goods aren&rsquo;t handled with care and end up damaged? What if an irresponsible driver falls off the grid for days and ends up holding your load hostage, interrupting your whole production cycle? And worst of all, what if the truck hauling your load ends up getting in an accident that results in a loss of life &ndash; and the courts deem you responsible for the death, since you negligently selected that carrier? (Yes, as terrifying as it is, this is a real possibility.)<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBy working with a non-asset based provider like Trinity, you can largely mitigate these risks. Our carrier compliance department exists solely to ensure the carriers we select to haul your freight are insured and compliant with federal regulations. Before a carrier is cleared for take-off, their records are examined, their reputation is checked online, their insurance is confirmed, and we verify the phone number provided matches their official FMCSA listing. Additionally, our logistics specialists are trained to verbally confirm with the dispatchers that they are indeed from the same carrier we booked. While none of our practices are 100% fail-safe, we have the resources and expertise to prevent your freight from falling into the hands of a non-compliant carrier.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhy take such a huge risk when you don&rsquo;t have to? Beyond all the additional benefits of working with a 3PL, the aspect of risk mitigation is often forgotten (or even twisted to make it appear that working with a 3PL is more risky... which could actually be the case, if that provider doesn&rsquo;t have the same best practices in place that we do.)

We don&rsquo;t ship in LTL quantities very often.<\/strong><br \/>\n\tTrinity has contracts with a number of LTL carriers who leverage the overall volume of business of our entire customer base.&nbsp; Shippers that have infrequent LTL shipments can generally see savings in their freight costs by using Trinity.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2.

By working with a reputable 3PL like Trinity Logistics, manufacturers\/shippers help to minimize the amount of risk to which they expose themselves.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSome risk is financial in nature. Cash advance (COMcheck, T-Chek, etc.), illegal &ldquo;double brokering,&rdquo; and fraudulent paperwork scams are just three examples of activities that fall under this category.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAfter taking care of their priorities, many traffic departments simply do not have time to fully research and properly select carriers. As a result, unless they work with an established broker like Trinity, many of these manufacturers\/shippers eventually get scammed in some way. Hundreds, thousands, or even millions of dollars later, the victims often end up reaching out to Trinity or another quality 3PL for assistance.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to being subject to direct financial risk, businesses&rsquo; reputations are frequently under attack. While a company ultimately cannot control what is said about it or what people think or feel about the firm as a result, the business can take proactive steps to, in effect, silence its critics by deciding to allow other companies to assist it with noncore functions. For example, while no manufacturer\/shipper would want its customer&rsquo;s freight to be transported by a carrier that had a history of major service failures, the manufacturer\/shipper might not have information on a carrier&rsquo;s service failure record. Large brokers like Trinity, on the other hand, because they contract with tens of thousands of carriers, often have such carrier performance data&mdash;even on small trucking companies and &ldquo;owner-operators.&rdquo; Therefore, Trinity and other major 3PLs are able to make more informed carrier selection decisions&mdash;thereby reducing the risk of service failure. Of course, less service failures means a happier customer and, hopefully, more business from them for you!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPlease give Trinity Logistics, a Transport Topics top twenty broker, an opportunity to further assist you with the risk management process.

The weight, density, class, commodity, and number of pallets all have an impact on the price of the LTL shipment, sometimes in seemingly confusing ways. It\u2019s definitely far more complex than shipping a truckload, and there are lots of little details that, if neglected, can have a negative impact on your supply chain \u2013 and your wallet.","content":"<p>\n\tIf you have any experience with LTL (less than truckload) shipments, you&rsquo;re probably aware that it&rsquo;s a complicated arena. The weight, density, class, commodity, and number of pallets all have an impact on the price of the LTL shipment, sometimes in seemingly confusing ways. It&rsquo;s definitely far more complex than shipping a truckload, and there are lots of little details that, if neglected, can have a negative impact on your supply chain &ndash; and your wallet.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMany LTL carriers employ &ldquo;weight &amp; research coordinators&rdquo; whose sole responsibility is to catch the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; who list an inaccurate weight or class on their bill of lading (BOL). They keep an eye out for any shipments whose description on the BOL just doesn&rsquo;t seem to match up with its appearance. They will physically examine your freight, and if they deem it necessary to inspect the contents or check the weight, they&rsquo;ll issue an inspection certificate&hellip; and the shipper foots the bill for the additional inspection. Even worse, if this happens to you, you&rsquo;re then &ldquo;flagged&rdquo; as an unreliable shipper and your freight will be inspected every single time you use that carrier.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThis is why it&rsquo;s imperative to make sure the weight and class on your bill of lading are accurate. Don&rsquo;t just guess, and don&rsquo;t try to be sneaky, either! You can&rsquo;t classify furniture as lumber, even though it was once lumber&hellip; (yes, believe it or not, people actually do this!) Of course, mistakes on the BOL more often come from accidental errors than they do from intentional manipulation. For example: sometimes, a shipper will routinely mark the class for a certain product as the same class it&rsquo;s always been for years &ndash; but unbeknownst to them, the classification has since changed. LTL classifications can change without notice at any time! It&#39;s hard to keep track of, but if you&rsquo;re caught using the wrong class, it can mean extra charges and fees for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnother frequent error is forgetting to include the weight of your pallets in the total weight calculation of your shipment. For example, if you use an ERP system, you may just multiply the weight of each box and forget to consider that the pallet adds weight as well. If you forget multiple pallets, that could add up to an additional 500 pounds you&rsquo;re missing. That&rsquo;s not just a few pounds off. Most LTL carriers have scales installed right on their forklifts that double-check the weight listed on the BOL automatically. If there&rsquo;s a significant difference, you will be charged for the extra weight&hellip; and &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; more extra fees.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\t<img alt=\"Confused about LTL shipping?

If you work with us on your LTL shipments, while we&rsquo;re ultimately not responsible for what you put on your BOL, we can help you with the process of accurately classifying your shipments and making sure everything jives. Our LTL team meets multiple times a year to go over classification changes, and if you&rsquo;re a frequent customer, we can even set up an alert to let you know that the classification for your product has recently changed.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe bottom line: shipping freight LTL is complicated, but the good news is that you don&rsquo;t have to do it alone.

This could not be truer when CSA is the topic of discussion.&nbsp; Brokers, owner-operators, and shippers all have a different view. This wide range in opinion has made this topic a national headline across the country, and it has even made its way to Congress.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFirst up, what is CSA? Compliance, Safety, Accountability is the &ldquo;pro-active initiative to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)&rsquo;s enforcement and compliance program to achieve the Agency&rsquo;s mission to reduce commercial motor vehicle crashes, fatalities and injuries,&rdquo; according to the US Department of Transportation.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How does it impact the transportation industry? The FMCSA created 7 ever-changing categories in which they felt placing guidelines would provide a higher standard for safety.&nbsp; The seven current categories are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>1. Unsafe driving<\/strong><br \/>\n\tData contained under this topic would include traffic violations and dangerous or careless operation of any commercial vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. Fatigued driving<\/strong><br \/>\n\tInstances that would be found under this heading would be hours of service violations or accident reports.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. Driver fitness<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThis includes Information such as if the driver had the training to drive a commercial vehicle or the proper licensing. Any accidents caused by medical conditions would also be found under this topic.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4. Controlled substances<\/strong><br \/>\n\tHere, they take note of violations that involve any controlled substance, like positive drug or alcohol test results. In addition, the lack of testing for substance abuse will also appear here.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>5. Vehicle maintenance<\/strong><br \/>\n\tViolations for mechanical impairments or accidents caused by mechanical failures will show here.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>6. Cargo related<\/strong><br \/>\n\tItems related to the security of the freight would be found here, such as shifting and proper handling of hazardous materials.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>7. Crash indicator<\/strong><br \/>\n\tRecords of accidents, including details, would be found under this heading.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe reasons for these differences in opinion lie below the surface of these seven categories. For an owner-operator who receives a &ldquo;safety evaluation&rdquo; and receives a poor report, thus placing them in the higher percentile for the category, that higher percentile could leave them unemployed. Yet the shipper who chooses not to use this carrier is pleased that their company reduced risk by not using an &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo; carrier.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo while there are many benefits to these CSA guidelines, such as carrier accountability and lower risk, it still makes for the perfect storm of opinion for all parties involved. It&rsquo;s important to educate yourself about CSA and come to your own conclusions. There are plenty of resources to pull from when trying to paint the full picture.

But for the past few years, after that one-week peak, the loadings then start to fall off gradually until the week of Thanksgiving, when a large drop-off occurs.&nbsp; After Thanksgiving, the volumes rebound back to where they were they were, and the gradual decline continues for about 2 more weeks, when the volumes start to drop quickly.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn summary, the peak season for the past few years has been a one-week period where the loadings spike, and then the very next week, we see them start to gradually decline. This has an effect in two different areas: capacity and price.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>CAPACITY<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThere are two factors that have an effect on container capacity; the first is simply the law of supply and demand. As the demand picks up, the supply will drop, and since there is an average of 12 &ndash; 14 days per intermodal load cycle, it will take at least two weeks before we see the supply start to build back up.&nbsp; So even though the data shows that that generally, we only see one week of spiked loadings, it can and will have an effect on supply for about 2-3 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe other factor that has an effect on container capacity is the IMC&rsquo;s hanging onto the empties and holding them even though they might not have a load for them.&nbsp; Basically, the IMC&rsquo;s are willing to pay the daily per diem for 3-5 days so they can then cover a load in the future.&nbsp; When this happens, it slows down the cycle time for the containers, resulting in fewer loads per box during peak season, which is the exact opposite of what you would normally expect to happen.&nbsp; When demand picks up, you would expect to see the utilization of the boxes increase drastically, thus more turns or loaded trips per month.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWith the spike in loadings occurring quickly, the draymen struggle to cover the pickups from the shippers, and then when the loads get to the destination, the draymen there struggle to get the loads delivered in a timely fashion.&nbsp; During the peak season of 2011, there were boxes available for loading; however, it was impossible to find a drayman to pick up the loads, so once again, empty time is added to the cycle of the container.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>PRICE<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThe laws of supply and demand certainly come into play with intermodal pricing during peak season; as the supply of equipment drops, the price per load goes up.&nbsp; It is no secret that in years past, there were charges put up front to &ldquo;buy&rdquo; an empty box (sometimes as high as $500) plus the surcharges or price increases the rails take, so any given lane could see a spike in cost of $200 - $650. These price increases are generally short-lived, and as the supply of equipment starts to grow, due to a reduction in demand, the price will drop back to where it was pre-peak season.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI know that this sounds a lot like Economics 101, but if you want it simple and sweet: during peak, the price will go up, and the availability of empty equipment and driver capacity will be tight.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"196","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Why You Should Sweat the Small Stuff","url_title":"why-you-should-sweat-the-small-stuff","entry_date":"1349713860","exerpt":"How many of you have ever been bitten by a mosquito?

It takes stock of what&rsquo;s going on in the trucking industry from top executives in the United States. It polls them each quarter on their business and what they predict in areas such as finance, equipment plans, drivers, and legislation, to name a few. While reading the survey, I encountered some alarming results!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the most alarming things about the survey results I read? 70 to 74% of carriers polled expect to add little or no capacity to their fleets in the next year. That means only 26 to 30% are expecting to add capacity, or additional trucks, to their available pool of equipment!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThis number is important to those of us in the transportation industry because we can immediately correlate that with a strain on commerce. As production levels begin to pick up, and industries head into one of the busiest shipping seasons of the year, one must wonder: who&rsquo;s going to haul it all?<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDid you catch the article in <em>Transport Topics<\/em>&nbsp; this week that posed the notion of shippers beginning to shift their business to asset based carriers and away from 3PLs, freight brokers, and non-asset based providers? I had to shake my head in wonder at the thought of any manufacturer or shipper resisting a relationship with a leading 3PL like Trinity Logistics. The value added by companies like ours is never more apparent than at times like this. In fact, 82% of Fortune 500 companies deal with at least one 3PL, proving that the nation&rsquo;s leading companies have seized that value for enhancing their own corporate growth.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor those companies still holding out and not utilizing a 3PL to help with their supply chain strategy, I&rsquo;d advise you to keep your eyes peeled for when your asset based carriers start to turn down loads. Perhaps they will begin to slip past the original ship date as they juggle trucks to meet increasing demand. As your business grows, are they poised to grow with you, or are you going to have to agree to increased prices after engaging in a bidding war with their other shippers for their pool of limited equipment?<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGranted, the pressures of finding good qualified drivers that can keep up with the CSA standards have made it even harder to fill the seats of the equipment they do have, let alone any new equipment they could hope to add to the fleet. It&rsquo;s no surprise that asset based carriers are seizing their opportunity to increase prices that have suffered or remained stagnant for a better part of a decade. Rising costs of operating compound their recruiting problems, leading to a perfect storm: a carrier capacity crunch.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tService failures will often be the first telltale sign of an asset based carrier with too much demand and not enough supply to meet the needs of all their customer base simultaneously. Without a 3PL to help diversify your freight across a broader carrier base, your own customer service could suffer as the missed pickups and service failures affect your reputation with buyers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor more background on these and other carrier capacity issues, and how you can work to combat them in your own business, check out our <a href=\"\/download-whitepapers\">free eBook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI welcome you to connect with me on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/trinity-logistics\">LinkedIn<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/trinity_tweeps\">Twitter<\/a>; I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts on the survey and subject.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"198","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"New 3PL Study Shows Alarming Trends","url_title":"new-3pl-study-shows-alarming-trends","entry_date":"1348764600","exerpt":"Eyefortransport.com just published their 2012 Global 3PL & Logistics Outsourcing Strategy report.

","content":"<p>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/eyefortransport.com\">Eyefortransport.com<\/a> just published their 2012 Global 3PL &amp; Logistics Outsourcing Strategy report. This study analyzed the relationships between 3PLs and their customers, and some of the data they reported in the summary of the study was quite eye-opening -- and at times, disconcerting! It seems like many 3PLs are going about their business quite differently than we do here at Trinity, and it would appear that they&#39;re suffering because of it. We&#39;ve summarized a few of the most interesting points from the study below:<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}3pl.jpg\" style=\"width: 611px; height: 30px;\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhat&#39;s up with that? We don&#39;t know about everyone else, but here it is our number one goal to provide outstanding service to our customers every single day, every single time. We want them to rave about us. It seems like in order to stay in business, many 3PLs are sacrificing their commitment to service in order to remain cost-competitive. Unfortunately, allowing customer service to fall by the wayside is a surefire way to end up with unhappy customers who will probably seek help elsewhere. Those consequences are very real when so few shippers are receiving \"outstanding\" service from their 3PL.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOn that note...<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}service.jpg\" style=\"width: 585px; height: 94px;\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\n\tClearly, the viewpoints of 3PLs and shippers are not aligned here. While 3PLs believe they need to cut costs (and in turn, let service suffer) in order to retain their customers, the customers are actually leaving because service is slacking. Luckily, this backs up the theory we&#39;ve had all along: customer service is more important than having the cheapest rate. While we pride ourselves on being price competitive in the market, we can&#39;t claim to have the cheapest price every single time (I&#39;m not sure if anyone can)! We can, however, claim to have the happiest customers who actually stick around and keep doing business with us over and over again due to the spectacular service they receive. Looks like some other 3PLs need to hop on that boat!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnd now for the most shocking:<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}engagement.jpg\" style=\"width: 441px; height: 62px;\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\n\tWell, that&#39;s eyebrow-raising. We&#39;re not quite sure how those other 40% are still in business at all. We love hearing from our customers - about everything and anything! What we&#39;re doing right, what needs work, what other ways we can help them, what they ate for breakfast... and we love engaging with our customers through social media channels, email, and this blog, too! So much of our industry happens behind a computer screen and over telephone lines that we&#39;ve made going on customer visits a huge part of our business. Meeting our customers and seeing what makes their business tick is extremely important to us. 3PLs should build strong relationships with their customers, founded on trust. If that&#39;s not a priority, then there&#39;s a problem.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe&#39;re happy that our commitment to customer service has enabled us to stay afloat in this tough economy.

How long have you been with Trinity, and how did you end up here?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tI&rsquo;ve been with Trinity for just over three and a half years. I started my career with another 3PL and then came to Trinity. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed every second of it &ndash; the atmosphere&rsquo;s amazing and the people are great. It&rsquo;s a different atmosphere than the one in which I learned about the industry, but I&rsquo;m happy to apply all that I&rsquo;ve learned here and I&rsquo;m really excited about everything we&rsquo;re moving toward in the future.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. What has been your favorite thing about working at Trinity?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tLunch Wagon, probably. I mean, Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, to have lunch prepared for us in the kitchen&hellip; it&rsquo;s great. I don&rsquo;t have to head out of the office and I can enjoy lunch at my desk and catch up on news and stuff like that. The annual Christmas party is really fun, too, down in Ocean City. And last year, when we hit a new benchmark, we had a spur-of-the-moment crab feast. It&rsquo;s all those small but unique experiences that really make Trinity a great company and a great place to work.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. So, you&rsquo;re a bit of a golfer&hellip; tell us about your golfing career!<\/strong><br \/>\n\tI don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a career, but&hellip; I love to play a lot. I didn&rsquo;t start playing until after college. I play every weekend and I try to play with my father as much as I can. It&rsquo;s time we get to spend together and we both enjoy the competition. I have to give him strokes now, which is kind of fun. I&rsquo;ve gotten better over the years as I&rsquo;ve invested more time (and subsequently more money&hellip;) into golfing.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4. And you played college football?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tI played football at Fairfield University in Connecticut. My freshman year was the first year they ever had football. We were Division 1AA and we had the second-best turnaround in NCAA history my second year. We finished 1-9 my freshman year, then 7-3 my second year, and then we won the championship my third year. I started all four years as an offensive lineman.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>5. What&rsquo;s the first thing you think your customers notice about you?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tI think they immediately notice the knowledge I have in the industry and that I&rsquo;m always willing to try creative things to accomplish what we need to accomplish, whether it&rsquo;s getting something delivered on time or getting it picked up on time or finding a way to make things happen &ndash;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m always willing to look at all sides of a problem.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>6. What do you thinks separates Trinity from our competitors?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tI think in this day and age, it&rsquo;s easy for people to operate under the assumption that price is the only thing that matters&hellip; but if your customer service suffers, then you&rsquo;re going to lose your customers. The truth is that it&rsquo;s easier to keep a customer than it is to get new customers. The people at Trinity genuinely care about our customers, about our freight, about our carriers, and it&rsquo;s that attitude and atmosphere that is at the heart of the Trinity DNA. We&rsquo;re not always going to be able to offer the absolute cheapest, bottom-line price &ndash;&nbsp; although I wish we could. But we&rsquo;re always going to give 110% to make sure the customer is serviced as best as we can.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you&#39;d like to chat with Pat about your transportation needs or challenge him to a round of golf, you can email him by <a href=\"mailto:pat.wallace@trinitylogistics.com\">clicking here<\/a> or give him a call on his direct line: <strong>(888) 235-3907<\/strong>.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"200","cat_name":"Company Culture","title":"Carrier Appreciation: A Message From Jackie Ochs","url_title":"carrier-appreciation-a-message","entry_date":"1348679580","exerpt":"Every week, we have been selecting a carrier to receive the Trinity Truck Driver Appreciation goodie box (which we lovingly refer to as a \u201cparty in a box!\u201d) This box includes goodies for your office and drivers to enjoy, courtesy of our team.

Thanks to new warehouse technology like warehouse management systems (WMS) and labor management systems (LMS) that are quickly gaining popularity, efficiency and productivity in the warehousing industry are at their peak, and warehouse mishaps are becoming a thing of the past. Due to the productivity perks, large companies with their own warehouses and distribution centers were quick to invest in this technology. Many of the features of these systems have the added benefit of decreasing the chances of product being damaged.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the most significant benefits on the WMS side is the ability to recognize the opportunity for a backhaul. Often, the system will redirect workers to pick up an item for replenishment that happens to be on the way back from wherever they&rsquo;re headed. Another awesome feature employed by some is called &ldquo;layer picking,&rdquo; which can lift up entire stacks of boxes at a time, eliminating the need to move boxes one-by-one, which is a lengthier task with a greater risk of a mishap.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\tBy utilizing a LMS in a warehouse, employee productivity skyrockets, too. Managers can directly evaluate employee performance and pinpoint where someone may need more training (in turn, decreasing the risk of an undertrained employee accidentally damaging your product!) They can also determine incentives based on employee-tailored, specific and accurate data, rather than sometimes misleading general averages. By determining the ideal amount of time it should take to complete any given task, the system can be programmed to measure productivity in incredibly accurate ways.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMore cool features: an impact tracking system can be implemented that alerts the system every time a truck or forklift runs into an object, leaving the driver accountable and available for coaching if necessary (another way of minimizing risk.) Some of these systems are so intricate that they can honk a loud horn and slow the vehicle down on impact, minimizing damage and bringing attention to the guilty party. Systems like this, when put in place, greatly increase individual worker accountability, and again, keep your product safer by heightening caution.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThis is just skimming the surface of warehouse technology, but I&rsquo;m sure you can see how these new technological advances greatly increase the chances of your product making it out of the warehouse just the way it entered &ndash;&nbsp; in tip-top shape!

How long have you been with Trinity, and how did you end up here?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tI have been in sales since my early twenties. Most people don&rsquo;t realize I&rsquo;m already in my thirties, thanks to my youthful good looks. I started out by selling advertisements in the Yellow Pages (for those of you who don&rsquo;t remember, people formerly used these things called &ldquo;phone books&rdquo;) and then I moved on to a career as an insurance agent. Almost two years ago, I started working here at Trinity. Although the product I&rsquo;m approaching customers with is different, the core values remain the same: I need to meet my customers&rsquo; needs and build a relationship with them that&rsquo;s based on trust.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. What has been your favorite thing about working at Trinity?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tBy far, the relationships and camaraderie that I&rsquo;ve built with my peers. Another perk is that there always seems to be some birthday cake or otherwise sugary treats at my disposal. It seems like we&rsquo;re always celebrating something.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. Obviously, music is important to you. What kind of music do you play and where?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tWell, after the band I was in, N&rsquo;Sync, broke up, I had to venture off on my own. This completely changed my style, and I started writing and singing a lot of my own acoustic, alternative music, as well as modern Christian worship music. I currently lead worship once a week in a coffeehouse setting. I also sing at weddings.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t<strong>4. What&rsquo;s something you think your customers immediately notice about you?<\/strong><br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tI would like to think they immediately notice my easygoing nature, my honesty, and my unwavering eagerness to help them with their needs.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>5.

We go the extra mile, always doing what needs to be done and more &ndash; whether that&rsquo;s reevaluating our rates, designing solutions for freight cost, ensuring truck availability through our partnerships, or just being their one-stop shop for whatever options they need to move their freight.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>6.

","content":"<p>\n\tIf you&rsquo;re struggling to ensure your transportation and shipping needs are being handled efficiently, quickly, and in a cost-effective manner, you might be overworking your ERP. In recent years, many businesses have been attempting to utilize their ERP as if it were a TMS (transportation management system) &ndash; and this is usually unsuccessful. Stop trying to make your ERP into something it&rsquo;s not! The poor guy is going to start having an identity crisis.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf an element of your business involves shipping or receiving product, you likely utilize an ERP (enterprise resource management) system, sometimes called an OMS (order management system). These software systems are usually employed company-wide, or at least across multiple departments, like the customer service, sales, accounting, billing, and shipping departments.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSome of the big-name ERP developers have caught onto this trend, and they&rsquo;re taking advantage of it. They&rsquo;ve started offering ERP &ldquo;add-ons&rdquo; that can be purchased for an additional cost&mdash;a la carte, if you will&mdash;to increase the functionality of the ERP and make it operate more like a TMS. Unfortunately, these add-ons are generally more expensive and less functional than an actual TMS, so investing in them tends to create a lose-lose situation for the company.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBusinesses are sometimes attracted to the idea of &rdquo;tacking on&rdquo; functionality because they want to continue using their ERP, and they balk at the idea of switching over to a TMS&hellip; change is intimidating, after all. However, a TMS can actually be seamlessly integrated with an ERP. Businesses can determine what information they&rsquo;d like to flow freely back and forth to and from both systems, and people who aren&rsquo;t directly involved in your company&rsquo;s shipping processes (like customer service or accounting) can still do everything right in the ERP without even touching the TMS, while those involved in transportation have all the advanced features of the TMS at their fingertips. Sometimes, it is possible to have your cake and eat it too!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you partner with a 3PL company like Trinity and utilize a best-in-breed TMS, you&rsquo;ll enjoy increased control over your shipments, significant cost savings, enhanced automation and efficiency, and amazingly customized reports that can help you improve your processes in every arena. These are things an ERP just can&rsquo;t do, no matter how much functionality you try to tack on.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDoes the idea of integrating your ERP with a TMS sound intriguing?

Currently sitting at over $4 per gallon, diesel fuel has been the long-standing fuel of choice for small and large trucks alike, but the combination of high expense and a push to &ldquo;go green&rdquo; has created a desire to find alternatives to diesel. Usage of natural gas trucks and electric trucks is quickly becoming more popular, but whether or not turning to these options actually creates a cost savings is debatable.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, Balqon, a corporation headquartered in California that develops electric heavy-duty trucks, has introduced a class 8 tractor that is fully electric, zero-emissions and mainly designed to haul inner city loads of less than five miles. For large, densely populated cities where smog and pollution are a serious concern, this could be a smart move. The tractor doesn&rsquo;t lack power, either&mdash;it can travel up to 150 miles on a single charge, run at speeds up to 70mph, and has the capability to haul 30 tons. Additionally, Frito-Lay recently added 45 electric trucks to their delivery fleet in California, on top of the 60-some electric trucks they already had on board. But considering the cost of these extremely pricey electric rigs, does making the switch actually result in money saved?<\/p>\n<p>\n\tA similar concern exists with switching to natural gas-powered trucks. Although the cost of natural gas itself is far less expensive than diesel fuel, the cost of the equipment is high. Natural gas systems increase the cost of a tractor by around $80,000. In order for money to be saved compared to running diesel equipment, the cost of diesel would have to reach nearly $5 per gallon. Regardless of this fact, it&rsquo;s predicted that 20% of trucks will be running on natural gas by 2020, and Frito-Lay, mentioned above, added 12 natural gas trucks to their delivery fleet as well.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIs the investment now worth the potential savings later on down the road? Perhaps, but only giant trucking companies are able to invest in these expensive alternatives right now. In the future, the cost of these different types of equipment will likely decrease and they will become more and more commonplace on the market and throughout the industry. Change is exciting, but it&rsquo;s also overwhelming when trucks have been running on the same kind of fuel for so many decades! What are your thoughts on these alternatives?

It comes as no surprise that prudent business people work to have a plan of attack using proven strategies, growth and expansion for their business. With the current economic condition, it&#39;s become even more important to be on the offensive with a strategic plan to do this. Many of our own agents are looking to expand their customer base in order to diversify the mix of their client base, especially those with over 10% of their business coming from a single company or a certain industry. It&#39;s difficult to spread a book of business equally, but it only takes one bad experience of seeing a customer walk away that held 20% of your revenue to devastate your business. It can cripple you, especially if you don&#39;t have a plan to expand.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe question is, how? Here are two proven tactics to grow your customer base:<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>1. Reach out to current customers for referrals to their suppliers, vendors, or even customers and friends<\/strong>. After researching these potential clients and learning everything you can about their operation, try making some \"warm\" calls using your mutual acquaintance&#39;s name as your opener. There are still a lot of customers who prefer a phone call to gain their business over the \"tech\" ways of email or through LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDo you fear rejection? Have faith! Getting past the fear of rejection is surprisingly easy. The best way to get over your fear of \"cold\" calling is to practice. Look through your address book and start with clients you haven&#39;t done business with in awhile and expand to people beyond your immediate network and pretty soon, you&#39;ll have gained the confidence to dial and smile to perfect strangers!<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. Social media such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mickeycockerham\">Linkedin<\/a> is a valuable and cost-effective tool to promote your services.<\/strong> You can search for businesses that match your current top customer list, and extend invitations to connect in a non-threatening manner. And you don&#39;t need a paid account to do this! Groups are also a great way to connect with potential clients and exchange tips that can result in business. Don&#39;t join the groups of other brokers, join the groups your customers belong to! There&#39;s no purpose in joining groups filled with your competition, so be different. Blogs are a creative way to use social media to boost sales.

And while that was a great start, the folks here at Trinity simply felt that one week a year wasn&rsquo;t enough to show adequate support to such an important industry&mdash;so now we&rsquo;re celebrating Truck Driver Appreciation Week every week, all year long!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tEach week, Trinity recognizes a carrier&rsquo;s hard work and dedication by presenting a token of our appreciation.&nbsp; Every carrier selected will be receiving a thank-you package filled with gifts, consisting of goodies for both the office staff and drivers. Throughout 2012, Trinity will be recognizing 52 carriers and their drivers for their dedication, long hours, commitment to service, time away from home, and helping make our success possible. Logistics specialists at Trinity have also been recording carrier shout-outs on video when a driver does an awesome job on a specific load, which are then posted to Facebook and Youtube.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTrinity Logistics is the only 3PL that celebrates this occasion year-round. &ldquo;We feel that it is important to let our carriers know how much they are valued,&rdquo; said Jackie Ochs, Carrier Relations Administrator at Trinity. &ldquo;Working with Trinity has given me the opportunity to talk to drivers and carriers and tell them how much they are appreciated.&nbsp; I have been given the chance to stop and appreciate where the products I buy, wear, and use all come from.&nbsp; Without these incredible drivers, we would not be where we are today.&nbsp; Thank you for spending your days out on the road to make our lives more comfortable.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJackie&rsquo;s quote rang especially true just a few days ago when we saw this eye-opening infographic posted by <a href=\"http:\/\/cdllife.com\/\">CDL Life<\/a>.

Your company likely has very specific warehousing needs, and it can be difficult to get past all the complicated lingo and sales pitches in order to discern which warehouses are actually a good fit for your business. Below, we outline 6-10 of the ten most important considerations you should think about when choosing a warehouse.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<br \/>\n\t<strong>Experience:<\/strong> Check their established date to make sure it&rsquo;s a good balance of age, showing they&rsquo;ve weathered the test of time, combined with newness of the facility with modern technology and touches to make things flow efficiently. Too old can mean antiquated processes, but too new can mean they&rsquo;re still working out the kinks, so to speak. Additionally, what are they experienced with? It&rsquo;s a simplistic example, but for food manufacturers and distributors crossing their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/default.htm\">FSMA<\/a> &ldquo;T&rsquo;s&rdquo;, you would definitely want a warehouse with lots of experience meeting strict food grade requirements.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Employees:<\/strong> Compare the size of their facility to the amount of employees and determine if you feel it&rsquo;s a good fit for the type of service you require. Are the employees knowledgeable about the types of services you need provided? Will you have a &ldquo;go to&rdquo; account representative whose primary responsibility it is to help make certain your needs (and the other clients&rsquo; needs) are addressed?<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Processes:<\/strong> How many doors do they have, and what is their system to manage the inbound vs. outbound traffic? Do they have a set staging procedure? What are their standard services (included in the price) vs. special services (for an extra fee)? Can they handle inspection, storage, dispatch, inventory, reverse logistics, packaging, labeling, or reporting?<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\t<strong>Risk:<\/strong> When you&rsquo;re using an outside vendor for warehousing, this can remove a significant part of the risks associated with logistics. Your partners will shoulder some of this burden as they help to resolve potential issues and work proactively to reduce traditional issues associated with moving product with machinery. However, your role must be active, regardless, in mitigating that risk, by asking them about their incident rates, safety plans, insurance coverage, and damage plans. Ask to see copies of their insurance coverage, and make certain their plans and reported incidents marry with your company&rsquo;s expectations. Find out how they handle issues when they arise in order to practice due diligence in protecting your company from poor vendor selection.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Technology: <\/strong>What type of Warehouse Management System do they use? Can your system for processing orders and managing your supply chain integrate with theirs? What type of handling equipment are they utilizing? If your product lines are numerous with assorted SKU&rsquo;s, you may need to search for warehouses with more advanced robotics or sorting conveyor belt systems to minimize human error when loading the trucks. No matter the sophistication of your product lines, at a minimum, you need to seek a partner that can provide regular reporting regarding your product moving into and out of their facility&mdash;preferably on a web-based platform that you can access at any time, from any location.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s clear that choosing a warehouse requires very careful consideration and a scrutinizing examination of all your needs.

After piling into our Director of Marketing&rsquo;s huge SUV (and saying a little prayer for safety, since she forgot to wear her contacts that day&hellip;) we drove up to northern Delaware and safely made it to our first stop at the Rogers Road office and warehouse, headquartered in New Castle.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOpened in 2007, Trinity Port Services (TPS) was developed as a response to our customers&rsquo; needs for more in depth, container-related services. It&rsquo;s a 14,000 square feet, 14-door cross-dock facility located at the Port of Wilmington, a full-service, deepwater port and marine terminal, and major Mid-Atlantic import\/export gateway. Our asset based sister company, Trinity Distribution Services (TDS) works together with TPS to haul loads out of the port.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1994, Trinity Distribution Services (TDS) was off and rolling as an asset-based company. Although referred to as a sister company, it should actually be called a brother company, as Trinity is owned by the Banning Brothers, Jeff and Darrel. Jeff Banning leads Trinity Logistics and Darrel leads the asset based divisions, TDS and TPS. With their fleet of approximately 40 trucks, 25 dry vans, and reefer containers, they provide dependable shipping focused along the Mid-Atlantic, as well as all the work they do with TPS, the port services arm of their operation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDarrel Banning was kind enough to show us around the port service facility, and we were able to get a sneak-peek at a couple of forklift drivers transferring a shipment of bananas off a truck that had just arrived from the port and onto a truck that was headed for Shoprite. We stood back in amazement and watched as they sped around the warehouse in complicated figure-8 patterns, seemingly coming within inches of each other as they zoomed past, rapidly moving back and forth between the two containers with obvious skill. &ldquo;These two guys have been working together forever, so they have a feel for each other&rsquo;s movements,&rdquo; Darrel explained.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnother highlight of our trip to TPS was exploring the cab of one of the TDS trucks. It was absolutely gigantic, with two beds and tons of head room &ndash; you could easily stand inside. Jackie, our Carrier Relations Administrator, and Kellie, our Marketing Coordinator, both got to hop in the driver&rsquo;s seat and pretend to drive (probably for the best), then Darrel took us for a cruise to get a feel for the trucking life.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}jackietruck.jpg\" style=\"width: 275px; height: 320px; float: left; margin: 10px;\" \/><em>Jackie poses in the driver&rsquo;s seat of a TDS truck.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\n\tAfter that, it was time to head to our next stop&mdash;the Port of Wilmington. Bill Mitchell, our Vice President of Port Services led the tour, starting with a requirement that we don some extremely oversized and silly-looking neon vests for safety and hop in the car to head to the port with our very own TWIC chauffer.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tUpon our arrival at the port, we were greeted by Sean Clancy, the Terminal Manager for Dole, a Trinity customer. As I&rsquo;m sure most of you know, Dole is a leading producer of pineapples and bananas, along with many other fruit products. Just last week, TDS hauled over 1.3 million pounds of fruit for Dole. Sean introduced us to the Dole Colombia, a gigantic ship that was currently being loaded &amp; unloaded (a process they do simultaneously) at the port. As we gingerly climbed the swaying ladder up to the deck, we could tell we were in for some awesome views of the port and surrounding city. Sean showed us around the multiple floors of the ship and took us out on the top deck to soak in the sights.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;Next, we were able to explore the warehouse that holds the bananas and pineapples. We learned about the specific temperatures required to keep the fruit fresh (for bananas, it&rsquo;s in the fifties, which felt very refreshing to walk through after spending the day outside in 90-degree weather!) and saw a very specific ripening color chart that specified all the different levels of banana ripeness. Who knew? I thought they could only be too firm, just right, or too mushy!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAt the end of the day, we were extremely grateful for the deeper level of understanding of these two Trinity sister companies that we had been given. Since they&rsquo;re about two hours away from our headquarters in Seaford, Delaware, we don&rsquo;t get to see the action first-hand very often, and it was a refreshing and interesting experience to see what their jobs are like on a day-to-day basis.

Your company likely has very specific warehousing needs, and it can be difficult to get past all the complicated lingo and sales pitches in order to discern which warehouses are actually a good fit for your business. Below, we outline 1-5 of the ten most important considerations you should think about when choosing a warehouse.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Location: <\/strong>Consider the current shipping locations of your suppliers, as well as the delivery locations you&rsquo;re arranging for customers. Where are most of those deliveries being made? Are your warehouses located in the optimal zones to minimize the costs for both your company and your client?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Access:<\/strong> Any public warehouse you&rsquo;re thinking about contracting or considering as a major distribution center will need to be easily accessible from major highway arteries. Additionally, if you&rsquo;ll be importing or exporting a great deal of material, they should also be close to major port locations with strengths aligned with your product type.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Client Profile:<\/strong> Do you recognize any of their clients? On average, how much square footage do each of those clients occupy? If they have 50 customers who only occupy a small amount of their space, that could be a warning sign that the warehouse doesn&rsquo;t have the experience to attract larger companies with more sophisticated requirements to command larger square footage utilization.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"last\"><strong>Storage Area:<\/strong> Will their storage area provide the capacity you require? It&rsquo;s important to not only ask about their storage area, but more specifically, what is presently available to you. Do they anticipate any storage becoming available in the future in order to accommodate your growth?<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Association Memberships<\/strong>: Are they active members of any well-known associations that can lend an extra bit of credibility to their operations? If they demonstrate their commitment to being card-carrying members of the IWLA (International Warehouse Logistics Association), for example, that shows they are interested in presenting themselves among groups of their peers, learning, gaining resources for improvement, and demonstrating their value over time.<\/p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s clear that choosing a warehouse requires very careful consideration and a scrutinizing examination of all your needs.

This is largely why we changed our name from Trinity Transport to Trinity Logistics back in January.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tA huge focus for us this year has been to make sure our customers are actually aware of the vast array of services we offer. Sometimes, a business might have transportation needs they aren&rsquo;t even aware of! Technology is constantly and rapidly evolving, changing the way transportation is organized. Many companies are still using very manual processes to arrange transportation&mdash;calling carriers for quotes, writing down shipments on paper&hellip; these methods are dated and cost our customers both time and money. By giving us a call and simply talking to us about how they&rsquo;re doing&mdash;and where they may be having issues&mdash;it can be revealed that we have a lot to offer a business in terms of managing their freight, whether it&rsquo;s their truckload shipments, LTL shipments, or both. We have a state-of-the-art TMS (transportation management system) and a whole team dedicated to designing solutions for companies who need to streamline and simplify their transportation.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnother area in which we have a lot to offer is LTL (less-than-truckload) services. Again, many of our customers who loyally do business with us for their truckload shipments sometimes have no idea that organizing their LTL shipments with us, as well, is an option&mdash;and a great one! We have access to a whole network of carriers and blanket pricing that can save some serious money for businesses who generally only have access to a small number of options if they&rsquo;re organizing their LTL on their own. In addition, we just developed a new and improved portal for customers to manage their LTL shipments, with as much or as little involvement from us as they desire.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBusinesses who prefer eco-friendly, green shipping methods might choose to limit the amount of product they move on diesel trucks&mdash;but we can meet their needs, as well, through our intermodal services. Shipping via train not only provides a significant cost savings, but is also far more environmentally friendly&mdash; the amount of fuel required is significantly less (a freight train can go about four times further on a single gallon of fuel than a diesel truck) and the carbon emissions are about three times less. For many companies, the idea of rail shipments is completely foreign, but our intermodal specialists are here to work with our customers and explore if this option is one that will fit their transportation needs.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs you can see, truckload is just a small portion of all we have to offer our customers!

As I&rsquo;m sure most of you know, this event raises money for cancer research through a fun and inspiring walk through the night, the goal being to keep at least one team member walking at all times. This cause is extremely important to us, as we have multiple cancer survivors who work here at Trinity&mdash; as well as many who have been affected by or who have lost loved ones to cancer. As such, Trinity Logistics has consistently been the Hope Sponsor for our local Relay, which is the highest level of sponsorship available (and equates to a donation of roughly $10,000.)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe spent the first half of this year fundraising in every way we could possibly think of. There is a tempting snack table in our office (which quickly became very popular) with yummy food and drinks available for team members to purchase all day long, with all proceeds going to Relay. We also did two basket bingos and two &ldquo;Weeks of Fun&rdquo; (dress-down weeks with crazy themes that team members could pay to participate in.) We sold delicious chocolate eggs at Easter-time for the cause, and in the month of May, the men at the office paid for the privilege to grow out their beards as a fun way to support the event. Even at the Relay itself, we were still fundraising by showing classic 80s movies on a projector screen and selling popcorn to hungry participants,<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThis year&rsquo;s Relay, which was on June 1st, 2012, fell on a dark and stormy day. Luckily, the event was moved into a parking garage, and all activities proceeded as planned. Live bands played through the night, and Team Trinity walked, barbequed and played games until the wee hours of the morning within the cool, dry safety of the garage. Participation was excellent, and while almost twenty Trinity team members attended the event, five continued to walk for the entire night&hellip; all the way until 6am. What a dedication to the cause!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tJackie Ochs, Carrier Relations Administrator at our Delaware corporate office, admires and appreciates Trinity&rsquo;s dedication to Relay. &ldquo;I could not have asked for a more caring and genuine company to be a part of.&nbsp; Participating in Relay for Life is something that I feel very strongly about.&nbsp; Being a cancer survivor, I strive to help make the dream of a cancer-free world a reality&hellip;. to continue the battle, to raise money, and to let everyone affected by cancer know that they are not alone.&nbsp; Trinity helps make this dream possible each year.&nbsp; Because of these events, I can stand here and tell you my story.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tCourtney Johnson, logistics specialist and Relay team captain this year, had similar feelings. &ldquo;I truly love how much Trinity gives back to its staff, its community and other foundations as a whole.&nbsp; I always try to contribute in much the same way, so when I heard about the Trinity Foundation supporting the Relay for Life, it was a no-brainer. My mother passed away from colon cancer in 2008, so I always try to raise money for its awareness and research.&nbsp; I also got to do some fundraising with some really cool people, meet new people, and save lives. Pretty cool, huh?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the reasons Trinity is such a great place to work is our office culture. Although there are many of us, we really are like one big family&mdash;there to support each other and bond together. That&rsquo;s why events like Relay are a perfect way for us to come together for a greater cause and rally for the team. Everyone is always excited and willing to help out in whatever way they can. Community service is an important puzzle piece in the whole picture of our team&rsquo;s passion and involvement within our company. If you find that morale is lacking in your workplace, take initiative and rally for a cause that&rsquo;s important to you! I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be surprised to see how many people step up and support you, and, in the process, the greater whole.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"225","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Got Clout?","url_title":"got-clout","entry_date":"1340025900","exerpt":"Delaware Office Director of Sales, Pat Wallace, discusses the importance of building clout with your provider and establishing a solid relationship.","content":"<p>\n\tAs a by-product of the worsening capacity crunch, shipper frustration is often being voiced in terms of the familiar old expression: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want all my eggs in one basket.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSome who advance this thinking may typically follow with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just playing the odds!&rdquo; or offer some rationale about wanting to use as many carriers and logistics providers as possible to &ldquo;protect their interests,&rdquo; or &ldquo;to get stuff done.&rdquo; Yet another common explanation for spreading business around: &ldquo;We need to keep everybody happy.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, those who advocate spreading out their options are finding that &ndash;in today&rsquo;s climate of economic uncertainty&mdash; more is not necessarily better, and being more focused on building minimal numbers of provider relationships to keep themselves &ldquo;happy&rdquo; may be a more productive attitude.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThere is growing evidence that &ldquo;the odds&rdquo; for beating capacity issues, &ldquo;protecting&rdquo; interests and getting better rates lie in the high-trust work relationships that emerge from limiting carrier and logistics provider choices.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTrinity Logistics Director of Sales Pat Wallace puts it this way, &ldquo;Due to capacity issues, savvy shippers recognize that using a wide assortment of providers can foster a false sense of security.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem, says Wallace, &ldquo;is that there is no way to fully leverage volume because it&rsquo;s too spread out. When a shipper&rsquo;s business is spread across many carrier and logistics companies, that shipper forecloses on the opportunity to build clout. He or she is no longer the big fish, and that&rsquo;s risky in today&rsquo;s capacity-driven climate.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen a decision is made to minimize provider choices, a shipper naturally exposes his or her business to limitation, but is in a much stronger position to reduce costs and fully leverage expenses. In addition, and perhaps equally important, provider limits gives rise to work relationships that spawn mutual clout.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Consider the banking industry,&rdquo; says Wallace. &ldquo;Who is going to work harder for you,&rdquo; he asks . . . &ldquo;one of five banks that you utilize for your financial needs . . . or one bank trusted with your checking, savings, mortgage, auto loan, bonds, etc.? And which of these situations will provide the most productive relationship? Which will regard your money as a deposit and which will treat it as an investment?

It&rsquo;s important to look beneath the surface of actual cargo shipping charges when estimating your total shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt&rsquo;s not like &ldquo;great freight rates&rdquo; never happen, or don&rsquo;t exist, but they are simply not as commonplace as they once were. The actual cost of shipping cargo is much more involved than merely paying the charges associated with the transportation company.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTotal freight cost also includes other factors. These include: the cost of storing inventory, packaging material, salaries of shipping clerks, computer system to track and monitor shipments, actual freight rates, and cost associated with delayed shipments, plus additional special circumstance expenses. Sure, it sounds like a lot, but there is no cause for panic!<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>SOME STEPS THAT CAN HELP YOU SAVE MONEY,<br \/>\n\tBE MOST PRODUCTIVE, AND MINIMIZE RISK<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\t1) <strong>MONITOR<\/strong> each of the above factors carefully.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2) <strong>GET<\/strong> experienced input on how to best package merchandise to take up the least amount of dimensional space, and minimize risk of damage. Damage control methods can vary greatly depending on shipment methods and types of carriers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t3) <strong>EMPLOY<\/strong> the help of a 3PL like Trinity Logistics to help match your specific needs to qualified available carriers. This type of service keeps costs lower by promoting competition, and &ndash;on your behalf-- includes the use of an information database.

This can often be accomplished on your provider&rsquo;s website or by receiving a daily report via email. It makes the carrier more accountable to deliver your loads on time.

With truckers on the road&mdash;in fact, they&rsquo;re on pretty much every road&mdash;every single day, they have a huge presence on our highways. This puts them in a very powerful position. Passing thousands of cars each day and spending their rest time at truck stops, truckers frequently witness criminal activity, whether it&rsquo;s illegal drug use, drug trafficking, drivers under the influence, or&mdash;the most troubling&mdash;human trafficking. Law enforcement agencies and nonprofits alike have recognized this vital fact, and they&rsquo;re reaching out to truckers in order to educate and encourage them to report what they see. Truck drivers are happily obliging, and they&rsquo;re saving lives in the process.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn Ohio, state troopers have designed a voluntary training program for truck drivers to illustrate what kinds of criminal activity they may witness during their travels and which tell-tale signs to look out for. Another important aspect of the program is simply to encourage truckers to call in and report their suspicions, no matter how small or how insignificant they may seem. Many truck drivers witness crime every single day and think it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;big enough deal&rdquo; to call 911. After going through the training program, the drivers reported that they felt much more &ldquo;relaxed&rdquo; about calling the police about the things they saw.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe most important thing for truckers to be aware of is human trafficking. Most people assume that human trafficking&mdash;essentially, girls being kidnapped and forced into prostitution&mdash;is an international problem, something that doesn&rsquo;t occur here in the USA. Unfortunately, this assumption couldn&rsquo;t be farther from the truth. Right here in America, underage girls are actually kidnapped and forced to sell their bodies (and threatened with death if they don&rsquo;t).&nbsp; What&rsquo;s most alarming: the most common destination for these girls is truck stops. They&rsquo;re forced to walk from cab to cab, knocking on each door, usually dressed in skimpy clothing, offering their services to truck drivers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMany truck drivers, uneducated about human trafficking, assume the girls are simply prostitutes by choice. But in reality, these girls are trapped, fearing for their lives and doing whatever it takes to survive. Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT) is a nonprofit organization created in order to spread awareness in the trucking industry and educate truckers about this horrifying reality. The organization has a hotline open 24\/7 for truck drivers to call if they witness any suspected incidents of human trafficking or young girls at truck stops.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn TAT&rsquo;s informational video, a young woman shares the tale of how she was kidnapped at 15 years old while walking to Wendy&rsquo;s. She was forced into prostitution and was only saved when a truck driver called 911 after witnessing her going from door to door at a truck stop. Now, thanks to the vigilance of a concerned trucker, she is married with a baby and lives a happy, normal life. Her mother expressed a tearful and grateful thanks to the driver who saved her life, whom they have never met.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are in the trucking industry, you can make a difference&mdash;share the <a href=\"http:\/\/truckersagainsttrafficking.org\/\">TAT website<\/a> with your fellow drivers and coworkers and encourage them to share it as well. Truckers have the power to put a huge dent in the human trafficking industry, but only if armed with the knowledge to do so. Here at Trinity, we fully support the efforts of the TAT to end this disturbing reality, and we encourage and extend our greatest thanks to truck drivers who keep an eye out for crime while on the road.

Johnson (D-Jefferson Farms), and New Castle County Councilman Jae P. Street (10th District) to announce the cleaner alternative to diesel generators.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This project is an excellent example of government, private business, environmental advocacy organizations and the community working together to find a safe, effective way of improving air quality and reducing health risks,&rdquo; said Governor Markell. &ldquo;We are always looking for ways to make our air cleaner and together, we are making progress.&rdquo;<br \/>\n\tOnce Trinity Port Services acquired the facility in 2007, company management immediately recognized the needs of the neighborhood, moved equipment and installed barriers to reduce noise and diesel fumes in the area. Additionally, the company has implemented environmentally-friendly improvements at the site.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2011, DNREC proposed the project at Trinity Port Services after DuPont applied for a Coastal Zone Act permit to install two large boilers at its Edge Moor facility in Wilmington. Delaware&rsquo;s Coastal Zone Act regulates heavy industrial activities, as well as new and existing manufacturing activities in the state&rsquo;s Coastal Zone. Coastal Zone regulations require companies to offset air emissions and other negative environmental impacts.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tUnder an agreement between DuPont and DNREC, DuPont, as a condition of its Coastal Zone permit, funded this project to offset air emissions from the boilers at the Edge Moor facility. In addition, DuPont provided funding for technical and administrative oversight of the project to the Clean Air Council through its diesel pollution reduction program.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to DNREC Secretary Collin O&rsquo;Mara, the project eliminates up to 120 tons of harmful air pollutants annually from the Trinity site. &ldquo;This Coastal Zone environmental offset project is an innovative solution to the longstanding air quality, odor and noise problems in the neighborhood,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The project ensures clean air by supporting the state&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to reduce diesel emissions.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This clean air project at Trinity Port Services underscores the value of partnering between government and the private sector, and proves that common-sense changes can deliver exceptional results,\" said EPA mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Shawn M.

The Clean Air Council has been honored to be a part of such an important project with DNREC, DuPont and Trinity Port Services.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Providing the funds for this project helped DuPont, the community and the environment in another way,&rdquo; said DuPont Edge Moor Plant Manager Elizabeth Schowe. &ldquo;In addition to improving the quality of life for our neighbors, we were enabled to install two clean-burning, energy efficient, gas-fired generators at our plant. That reduced our dependence on a less efficient and less clean coal-burning power producer.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Those of us who live next to this facility truly appreciate everyone&#39;s efforts on this important project,&rdquo; said Sheila Berkel, Director of the Rose Hill Community Center. &ldquo;So often our community seems to get overlooked on issues that negatively impact one&#39;s quality of life.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re excited about what&rsquo;s being done here today, and we certainly hope our leaders and elected officials will continue to focus their attention on the needs of the people who live near industrial plants like this one.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This project demonstrates Trinity&rsquo;s commitment to our community as well as our environment,&rdquo; said Trinity Port Services Company President Darrel Banning.&nbsp; &ldquo;We appreciate the teamwork and collaboration with all of the involved parties for the common goal of cleaner air.

This, objectors say, seems in conflict with the mission to improve safety and reduce driver fatigue.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frustration with a rule that requires drivers to spend eight consecutive hours in the sleeper berth instead of being able to split those hours up as they choose so long as no period in the sleeper berth is less than two hours.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFlurries of driver-generated publicity underscore the need for greater flexibility on the sleeper berth rule.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Help me answer the question,&rdquo; Ferro said. &ldquo;How do you provide that flexibility and ensure compliance.

This is also the same individual who serves as yours and your logistics service provider&rsquo;s single point of contact.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>When you ship by rail<\/strong>, a trucker (called a drayman) picks up the load, then in-gates the load to an intermodal facility where the container is separated from the Chassis (the under carriage, wheels, etc.) and then picked up by crane and mounted on a flat car.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The railroad<\/strong> then organizes, schedules, and sends your load to a destination facility.

If one operating part breaks or fails to perform, all the other points\/parts are affected.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBe aware that while railroad schedules are not always on time, they are generally consistent within a framework of given hour periods. To be safe in estimating delivery time, it&rsquo;s usually best on the average to figure a day longer in transit than you might for an over-the-road truck.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The bottom line is:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\t1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on your required points of origin and ultimate destination, shipping by rail is more economical in almost every instance.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carbon emissions involved with rail transit are far fewer than those of over-the-road trucks, which means that rail shipping is a far greener and more environmentally sustainable method of shipping.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTrinity Logistics provides shippers with fully-informed, highly-experienced input on the details of whether intermodal shipping is in your best interests.

Let&#39;s call this imaginary freight broker B.S.B. for Bad Seed Brokerage.

They can submit their invoice to the shipper and insist on payment, and the shipper is then forced to pay twice for the same shipment. Bet that 10% savings doesn&#39;t look so great now, does it?<\/p>\n<p>\n\t2. They can file against B.S.B.&#39;s Surety Bond. That&#39;s a little like an insurance policy for those who work with freight brokerages. It&#39;s required by law by the FMCSA in order to legally operate as a transportation broker, and helps to fight fraud in our industry. The carrier can file a claim against the bond in order to receive their settlement. Only $10,000 is required by law, but if New Hampshire Rep. Frank Guinta gets his way, it will be increased to $100,000 by the proposed bill H.R. 2357: Fighting Fraud in Transportation Act of 2011.

A few weeks ago we were celebrating Christmas and now the New Year is upon us. The New Year will bring many changes to the trucking industry and the first major change drivers and shippers will notice is &ldquo;how time flies&rdquo; when they&rsquo;re delivering product to the market this year.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2010 the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) proposed a change in the Hours of Service (HOS) regulations. One of the major and most controversial changes proposed by the FMCSA was to reduce driving time from 11 hours per day to 10 hours per day. The proposed change could take away a potential 300 miles a week from a driver and possibly delay many shipments. A reduction in driving time could lead to increased costs for shippers, carriers, and consumers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We&rsquo;re concerned that the federal government is imposing too many union rules upon those who aren&rsquo;t required to be in a union&rdquo;, said Jay Fuoss, who is a driver that represents a carrier based in Indiana.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOn December 22, 2011, after a long overdue announcement, the FMCSA released the specifics of the new HOS regulations. In the end, the proposal to reduce driving time by an hour per day failed to be adopted, and driving time will remain at 11-hours per day.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Although the FMCSA did not reduce driving hours, they have announced many other changes and updates that will have an effect on drivers and shippers.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>11-Hour Driving Limit<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThe FMCSA will not be reducing driving time by one hour; however, drivers that do drive for 11 hours per day must have 10 consecutive hours off duty. This will help to reduce driver fatigue and will help reduce the number of accidents.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>14-Hour Limit<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThe 14-hour limit will not allow drivers to drive beyond the 14th consecutive hour after coming on duty. The 3-hour difference between the 11-hour driving limit and the 14-hour limit gives drivers the opportunity to complete various non-driving duties such as loading and unloading their truck, receiving required inspections, and re-fueling, as well as non-working duties such as meal breaks. After completing an 11-hour driving limit and a 14-hour limit period, the driver will be required to take10 hours off-duty.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>60\/70-Hour On-Duty Limit<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThe 60\/70 Hour On-Duty limit will not allow drivers to drive after 60\/70 hours on duty in 7\/8 consecutive days. A driver will not be allowed to be on-duty for more than 60 hours per 7 days or 70 hours on-duty per 8 days. A driver must take 34 or more consecutive hours off duty before restarting a 7\/8 day consecutive period.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Sleeper Berth Provision<\/strong><br \/>\n\tDrivers using the sleeper berth provision must take 8 consecutive hours in the sleeper berth, plus a separate 2 consecutive hours either in the sleeper berth, off duty, or any combination of the two.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;They are focusing too much on safety rather than the struggling economy&rdquo;, said Vlad Maksimov, who is a driver that represents a carrier based in Oregon.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough the FMCSA did not reduce the driving time by one hour per-day, the other changes to the Hours of Service regulations have the potential to interrupt the transportation process and have the potential to increase already rising costs.

Transportation costs should run consistently in line with your company&#39;s sales. As you grow, so should transportation costs. However, it&#39;s important to review your pattern of freight spend in relation to sales in order to set your benchmark. Above average increases in transportation costs could indicate your expenses are cutting into your bottom line. When your freight spend becomes a significant percentage of your total revenue, it starts to have a negative impact. To put it in perspective, if you average $1 million in annual sales, imagine the impact paying or saving an additional $10,000 a year in transportation could have on your bottom line.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat are your costs?<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tIn order to understand your transportation costs as a percentage of your revenue, you first have to understand what your transportation costs actually are. While this sounds really obvious, many factors could actually make this a rather complicated undertaking. For example, many companies rely on email and spreadsheets to manage their transportation, so the ability to generate this type of reporting may be non-existent. In addition, some companies roll their transportation costs into the price of their product and have no way of separating this out within their current system. As a result, many companies are not sure how much they are spending on transportation.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tDetailed Reporting<\/h3>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">Detailed reporting is required to truly determine how much you are spending on freight. If you cannot determine what percentage of your sales is being spent on transportation, then you may want to consider budgeting in a TMS or ERP system that can provide you with this type of functionality. The long-term benefits will far outweigh the initial upfront costs. Having access to detailed reporting will allow you to take the appropriate action, whether it&#39;s looking for efficiencies to offset the increases to your transportation costs, or working with your salespeople to sell your products at a higher price. Determining your true freight costs can drive actions that can have a major impact on your bottom line.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you&#39;re not sure where to start or would like some help analyzing your costs, we would be happy to work with you.

The project demonstrates Trinity&rsquo;s support of greener achievements as an EPA Smartway Partnership member, as a partner in the American Chemistry Council&rsquo;s Responsible Care&reg; program, as well as creators of the official Trinity nationwide corporate purpose statement. &ldquo;To continually improve people&rsquo;s lives by constantly striving to be our best&rdquo; is the underlying drive for Trinity&rsquo;s participation in these and other initiatives to come. The project is made possible by an agreement between the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) and E.I. DuPont de Nemours Co. (DuPont), which required DuPont, as a condition of its Delaware Coastal Zone permit with DNREC, to fund a project that offsets air pollutants from two new boilers at DuPont&rsquo;s Edge Moor facility in Wilmington.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs the offset project, DNREC proposed a project at Trinity&rsquo;s Roger Road site near the Port of Wilmington that replaces 20 diesel generators that power refrigerated storage containers with electrified outlets, significantly reducing air pollutants in the area by up to 120 tons annually. Trinity Distribution Services in conjunction with their Port Services division had initiated the project concept in an effort to incorporate their corporate interest in ways they can reduce impact on our environment. DuPont agreed to provide $225,000 to replace the diesel generators and an additional $25,000 to fund technical and administrative oversight of the project by the Clean Air Council through its diesel pollution reduction program.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOn October 6th, 2011, the installation project of the electrified outlets began, and could take up to six months. Once completed, the Clean Air Council, along with Trinity, DNREC, and DuPont, plan to hold an event celebrating the project and the environmental benefits to the community.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>About DNREC<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control&rsquo;s mission to ensure the wise management, conservation, and enhancement of the State&rsquo;s natural resources, protect public health and the environment, provide quality outdoor recreation, improve the quality of life and educate the public on historic, cultural, and natural resource use, requirements and issues.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>About Clean Air Council<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tClean Air Council is a member- supported, non-profit environmental organization dedicated to protecting everyone&#39;s right to breathe clean air.

Fortunately, there will be virtually no impact to Trinity customers from LTL carriers taking general rate increases. See why!","content":"<p>\n\tOver the last few weeks, LTL (Less Than Truckload) carriers have begun announcing general rate increases. Fortunately, there will be virtually no impact to Trinity customers from LTL carriers taking general rate increases. Trinity has negotiated agreements with the majority of LTL carriers we do business with that are not subject to general rate increases. Our negotiated agreements take into consideration our nationwide volumes to secure some of the best possible pricing in the marketplace. Trouble is, we can provide the best possible pricing on the LTL shipment, and you can still end up with extra charges on the invoice! No one likes surprises, least of all involving money, so listed below are some tips to help avoid unforeseen charges on LTL service invoices.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>BE READY<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tLike truckload, the LTL carriers have begun charging for called in pickups and they are not given the freight when the driver arrives. These charges vary with each carrier from $30 to $100 each time they attempt to pick up freight.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important to communicate with the shipping facility to coordinate the correct pick up date for the freight to avoid this charge.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>DETAILS, DETAILS, DETAILS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tGive all of the details about your LTL shipment needs upfront to avoid surprise accessorial charges, even if you aren&rsquo;t sure if it&rsquo;s pertinent to the conversation. Does it require a delivery appointment, do both ends of the shipment have a dock or is a liftgate required for the delivery, etc? These requirements can result in extra charges from the LTL carrier but knowing the details from the start could also make a difference in the choice of the carrier, lining up one that doesn&rsquo;t charge for a service you require for example. All LTL carriers have different rates for the &ldquo;extras&rdquo; and some of these charges are negotiated in our tariff pricing. Be patient when we ask a lot of questions, we&rsquo;re using our experience to avoid costly surprises on your behalf!<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>WHAT&#39;S IT WORTH?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is the value of the freight? The liability for spot quote freight is only $1.00 per lb but we can also offer coverage (shippers interest insurance) to make sure the value is covered in case of a claim. This is a valuable product at a reasonable charge to ensure the freight is covered.&nbsp; LTL freight moves through their system by stopping at many terminals and changing trailers before it reaches the final destination.&nbsp; It does not stay on one trailer. Volume freight does not have a guaranteed delivery date and can require additional days in transit as the freight LTL moves as capacity is available.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>DON&#39;T FUDGE THE WEIGHT<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen shippers do not have scales at their facilities, it could be tempting to give an approximate weight. Trouble is, the freight could be reweighed by the carrier. This also results in additional charges not only for the extra weight but also a charge for the reweigh &ldquo;service&rdquo;. Know the weight of your pallet, and if you don&rsquo;t, expect the price fluctuation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>DON&#39;T GUESS THE CLASS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tKnow the class of the freight and have it on the bill of lading along with the NMFC number to avoid inspections. If you&rsquo;re uncertain, talk to our LTL team about the commodity so our experts can guide you. The worst thing you can do is guess or rely on &ldquo;what&rsquo;s always been used before&rdquo;. LTL carriers can and will inspect the freight to invoice for the correct class, resulting in higher charges!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe important thing is to lean on your Trinity representative, ask questions about the freight and the LTL process. It&rsquo;s our job to deliver solutions and education, use us as your resource. It may seem inconvenient but it could save you many surprise charges in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"\/freight-services\/ltl\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}LTL_Call_to_action.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 139px;\" \/><\/a><\/p>"}, {"ID":"255","cat_name":"Freight Agents","title":"Ten Questions for Interviewing Freight Brokers; A Shipper's Perspective","url_title":"ten-questions-for-interviewing-freight-brokers-a-shippers-perspective","entry_date":"1316200080","exerpt":"As Americans look hopefully to the future, battle weary from the recession, companies are seeking ways to find cost savings in order to combat the erosion of profit margins.

One method being employed to trim the amounts spent along the supply chain is to build a relationship with a freight broker, commonly referred to as &ldquo;3PL&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Third-Party Logistics&rdquo; suppliers.<\/p>\n\n<p>By working with a freight broker, you are borrowing their expertise that often takes several decades to build in order to generate significant cost savings in your logistics budget.&nbsp; A good broker is on the front line of trends, not only their industry, but other main industries depending on their core competencies.&nbsp; Brokers are able to quickly ascertain which mode of transportation is best for your freight, and can offer recommendations based on seasonality, capacity, and even the weather to guide you to attaining your logistic goals.&nbsp; Depending on their size, you can benefit from their buying power, commanding far better rates based on their volume.&nbsp; These are only a few advantages to working with a 3PL, so for those of you who are starting to nod their heads in agreement, I want to point out the top 10 questions to ask when you&rsquo;re choosing a freight broker to suit your needs.&nbsp; These are critical to making sure that you will maximize your savings while minimizing your risk!<\/p>\n\n<p>1. <strong>May I have a copy of your brokerage authority?<\/strong> Always verify the broker is operating under legal authority given by the FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration), whom licenses all transportation intermediaries.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be fooled by motor carriers who are offering to broker your freight without proper authority to do so.&nbsp; Trinity&rsquo;s authority is available online for customers to download on our website, <a href=\"\/carriers\/documents-downloads\">Click Here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>2. <strong>How many years have you been in business?<\/strong> This is an indicator for the longevity of the business, and shows a measure of the type of experience and expertise you can expect from them.&nbsp; For example, Trinity is celebrating its 33rd year in 2012 as a privately owned family business, offering decades of knowledge and service to customers and carriers.<\/p>\n\n<p>3. <strong>What is your dispatch process like? <\/strong>Be weary of brokers that just fax carriers the details of your load, handing off the entire process. It&rsquo;s almost as if they&rsquo;ve washed their hands of it! At Trinity, our dispatchers are communicating along every step of the process. We perform quality checks to make sure they loaded and delivered on time.&nbsp; We are managing the load and ensuring customer service!<\/p>\n\n<p>4. <strong>How many employees do you have and how many offices?<\/strong> It&rsquo;s doubtful anyone will admit to being a &ldquo;one man operation&rdquo;, but you want to make sure they have enough resources to properly service your account.&nbsp; Even if your freight is regional, you should look for a broker with nationwide presence.&nbsp; In doing so, you&rsquo;ll ensure that as your company grows, you won&rsquo;t have to wait for the broker to &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; when you begin to move loads outside of their region. Trinity has over 90 offices nationwide and over 200 team members to give customers the advantage of our expansive network in all areas of the country.<\/p>\n\n<p>5. <strong>What are your carrier pay terms?<\/strong> They should share information on how quickly they pay the carriers, and their financial strength, but you should always run your own credit check to ensure their claims.&nbsp; The last thing you want to have to do is explain why you had to pay a freight bill twice to your superiors.&nbsp; Trinity offers each contracted carrier quick payment, load advances for fuel, and direct deposit, allowing them to choose for themselves how quickly they&rsquo;d like to be paid.<\/p>\n\n<p>6. <strong>What steps do you take to ensure carrier compliance?<\/strong> Make sure they are checking each carrier for proper authority, insurance, and their CSA Scores. Also, make certain they have contracts with the providers.&nbsp; Good brokers that perform due diligence protect you against potential lawsuits. Trinity has an entire team of professionals to facilitate this process, it&rsquo;s that important!<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"last\">7. <strong>What associations do you belong to?<\/strong> First and foremost, you want to make sure they are members of the ethical Transportation Intermediaries Association (TIA).&nbsp; Other associations, such as the Better Business Bureau, are icing on the cake! You want to work with a freight brokerage firm that&rsquo;s committed to marketplace ethics as a reflection of your company&rsquo;s image.&nbsp; Trinity is a member of TIA along with many other reputable associations.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re also past recipients of Better Business Bureau Torch Award for Marketplace Ethics.<\/p>\n\n<p>8. <strong>What types of services do you offer?<\/strong> Say no to one trick ponies! You need a freight broker to call whether you&rsquo;re moving a truckload, a pallet, a rail box, or an ocean container.&nbsp; When you can make that one call and forget about it, you&rsquo;re able to get back to your business. Trinity offers a wide scope of services so our clients can make one toll free call to get their freight delivered, no matter which mode required.<\/p>\n\n<p>9. <strong>May I have your shipper and carrier references?<\/strong> Think back to your last job interview, when you were asked to provide references. You put your best ammunition out there, didn&rsquo;t you? Freight brokers will too, of course, but when you call the reference, make sure to ask about their best and worst experiences with the broker.&nbsp; If you can deal with the worst and are excited by the best, you&rsquo;ve found a good match!<\/p>\n\n<p>10. <strong>May I have a copy of your surety bond and insurance certificates?<\/strong> You should have these in hand before working with any freight broker.&nbsp; The $10,000 surety bond is required by law for all brokers, providing protection for carriers in the event that a broker fails to pay freight charges.&nbsp; Most brokers carry contingent cargo as an added layer of protection for shippers, and some even carry liability insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Trinity recently increased our surety bond to $250,000 for additional customer security! We&rsquo;re also believers in insurance policies, carrying a million in general liability, auto liability, ten million in excess liability, as well as $500,000 in worker&rsquo;s compensation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Each of the ten questions considered individually won&rsquo;t provide a healthy indicator of the strength of the freight broker, but when grouped together in the set of ten, you begin to gain a healthy image of the broker.&nbsp; Creating an alliance with a freight broker can help achieve lower costs, higher profit margins, and an ally in the fight for survival in the tough economic market we&rsquo;re facing.&nbsp; When chosen carefully, a good freight broker can be your greatest competitive advantage, and I promise you, your customers will feel the difference.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information about Trinity&rsquo;s services, contact <a href=\"mailto:brandy.mcmullen@trinitylogistics.com\">brandy.mcmullen@trinitylogistics.com<\/a> or call <strong>(800)-846-3400 x3935<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<div id=\"slidebox\"><a class=\"close\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/get-a-quote?utm_source=SlideInCTA&amp;utm_medium=TenQuestionsInterviewingFreightBrokersBlog&amp;utm_campaign=CTA\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}getaquote-slide.jpg\" style=\"width: 90%; height: auto; border: none;\" \/><\/a><\/div>"}, {"ID":"256","cat_name":"Company Culture","title":"National Truck Driver Appreciation Week","url_title":"national-truck-driver-appreciation-week","entry_date":"1315854900","exerpt":"This week is National Truck Driver Appreciation week!

Humor me and please keep reading anyway, I may possibly add one or two items that you haven&rsquo;t considered in the past.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>What&rsquo;s an IMC?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tFirst, let&rsquo;s discuss what an &ldquo;IMC&rdquo; (Intermodal Marketing Company) is today versus what they were in years past.&nbsp; Many years ago when intermodal movements were just beginning on the railroads, the rail carriers quickly realized that it was very difficult for them to &ldquo;retail&rdquo; their service directly to potential customers.&nbsp; The railroads were accustomed to dealing with a shipping public with locations on their property with rail tracks running direct into their facilities! These were customers that moved grain, paper, lumber, steel, and automobiles as a few examples of the commodities that worked well for the rails.&nbsp; There was untapped opportunity for new shippers and manufacturers to move their freight by train, but they didn&rsquo;t have to be located close to the railroad. In fact, many rail customers are several miles from the nearest railroad tracks.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tIMCs (Intermodal Marketing Companies) started popping up around the country, providing marketing and sales for the railroads. Railroads readily accepted the IMCs&rsquo; help for marketing and selling their intermodal service! Originally the functions and responsibilities of an Intermodal Marketing Company were very limited. Over time those responsibilities have changed greatly to the point they not only provide sales, pricing, and marketing, but are also responsible in many cases for securing the container to move the load as well as the draymen to pick up the load at origin and destination.&nbsp; The Intermodal Marketing Company also provides one other key function today they didn&rsquo;t provide in years past, and that is customer service.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t<strong>The #1 Differentiator<\/strong><br \/>\n\tCustomer service is one function that truly differentiates one Intermodal Marketing Company from another.&nbsp; Some intermodal marketing companies have nearly eliminated the customer service function, relying heavily on cheap pricing to secure freight for shipping intermodal. I strongly recommend you consider customer service as a required function whether you&rsquo;re renewing intermodal contracts, doing spot quotes, or just starting to move your freight by train. Let me paint a picture for you. There are only a few &ldquo;Class I&rdquo; railroads left in the United States and Canada, in fact only two Class 1 railroads in the West, only two in the East, and one in the Midwest.&nbsp; This means all of your intermodal freight will move on one of these five railroads and you&rsquo;ll likely experience either good service the rail carriers provide, or you&rsquo;ll suffer from issues the railroads are having. These include wash outs, derailments, hurricanes, mudslides, etc.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe element that separates the great Intermodal Marketing Company from the poor Intermodal Marketing Company is how well they communicate the issues with you, the customer, and how that may affect your movement on a train. Many IMCs simply provide an online tracing tool, leaving it up to the customer to find out if any delays are going impact their shipment. Other IMCs will have automated faxes or emails broadcast to the shippers with very generic information about the issues. The &ldquo;best&rdquo; IMCs will create the type of communication you value. They will offer the online tracking combined with a personal touch and contact when you prefer it, letting you know about the issues that might affect your pick-up or delivery, and also offering alternatives when solutions are needed. They keep your freight and your best interests at the forefront of every conversation and interaction.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Asset Based or Non-Asset Based<\/strong><br \/>\n\tAnother consideration when selecting an IMC is to weigh the importance of being an intermodal asset owner or a non-asset owner? While this is an item that certainly differentiates the IMC&rsquo;s, this element should not be one of your main deciding factors on which IMC you select. There are several excellent IMCs that move a lot of volume on trains do not possess intermodal equipment. Being an asset based Intermodal Marketing Company will provide only a small amount of leverage on pricing. I have heard many asset based carriers make the sales pitch that their company is better than company &ldquo;XYZ&rdquo; because they own assets, thus they have the ability to guarantee equipment for all shipments. The downside is the asset based IMC is more concerned about &ldquo;turn times&rdquo; or &ldquo;trips per month&rdquo; on their assets than they are about providing good customer service to you. The IMC without assets in most cases has access to just as many intermodal containers (in some cases even more), but if solely focused on your needs and serving the best interest of your shipment rather than their equipment.&nbsp; This is certainly an item that differentiates IMCs, but I feel it should be weighted very lightly when choosing the &ldquo;best&rdquo; IMC for your needs.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>All Aboard the Green Train<\/strong><br \/>\n\tIssues are affecting our environment, the fact is not surprising anyone reading this blog. Chances are your company has even launched a &ldquo;go green&rdquo; initiative, whether it&rsquo;s recycling office paper or joining the EPA&rsquo;s Smartway Partnership. Moving your freight by train will result in a tremendous reduction in the carbon emissions into our atmosphere. When you are looking for the &ldquo;best&rdquo; intermodal provider, this is an item you should certainly consider. Are they a member of Smartway, do they have active programs in place to help the environment today and tomorrow?<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Where Do You Rank?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tAnother element that certainly tells the story about an IMC is their current client base. Who do they currently do business with? Several IMCs tout that 80-85% of their volume and revenue comes from 10% of their customers. What this tells me is how much they like doing business with very large companies. Other IMCs prefer to do business with small to medium sized customers so their distribution of volume and revenues are spread over a much larger customer database. Typically the IMC catering to smaller clients has a natural knack for making the smallest customer feel just as important as their largest customer. Which type would you prefer to deal with? Who would you think values your business more?<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Continuous Improvement<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThe final deciding factor on how to select your best IMC involves the dreaded word &ldquo;change&rdquo;. There are many IMCs that are happy with the way things are now, while others are continually looking for ways to embrace change, either in processes or technologies. They&rsquo;re doing this in order to improve how they are doing things for the betterment of the customers (for you)! I will certainly concede that change for the sake of change isn&rsquo;t good, but change for improving service to the customer is something that differentiates a complacent intermodal provider from one striving to be the best.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt is my sincere hope that the list of items above will stimulate some thoughts for you the next time you need to move an intermodal shipment. No doubt you have noticed that I didn&rsquo;t include much in my blog about price. Trust me, leave it on the bottom of your decision criteria and you will be able to select the &ldquo;best&rdquo; long-term intermodal provider for your business needs without concentrating on price.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor more information on Trinity&rsquo;s intermodal division, email or call me (866) 811-4312.

It is still unclear how much of an impact CSA will actually have on the industry, but industry analysts believe as many as 200,000 drivers could lose their jobs as a result of the new regulations.&nbsp; Some of these drivers should probably be taken off of the road, but many of them are just going to be victims of circumstance. The more you drive the more likely you are going to be to get into an accident or get a speeding ticket. There are going to be many experienced professional truck drivers that are no longer going to be able to make a living driving a truck. These are drivers that have experience handling your freight and driving trucks in bad weather.&nbsp; Many of these experienced drivers are going to be replaced by drivers with no experience.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen someone is driving 80,000 lbs on a highway at 65 mph you want that person to have as much experience as possible.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs a result of CSA, experienced drivers with good scores will be in high demand and will be able to act as &ldquo;free agents&rdquo;.&nbsp; Good drivers will be able to demand higher wages, which will eventually be passed on to shippers.&nbsp; You can check out the FMCSA website for more information about CSA <a href=\"http:\/\/csa.fmcsa.dot.gov\/default.aspx.\">http:\/\/csa.fmcsa.dot.gov\/default.aspx.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Hours of Service<\/strong><br \/>\n\t<strong>(HOS)<\/strong>-&nbsp; There will be a final ruling in October of 2011, but it is believed that the biggest change will be to reduce the number of driving hours per day from 11 to 10. This does not sound like a lot, but many shippers operate on regional distribution models and reduction of just one hour per day could devastate many of these models. Over the course of a week a driver may drive over 300 miles less which would have a big impact on that driver&rsquo;s pay. Drivers will want to be compensated for the lost wages.&nbsp; In addition this will require more trucks on the road to move the same amount of freight that is being moved today. Additional trucks on the road would cause even more congestion to the nation&rsquo;s roadways causing additional traffic which could result in lost hours for drivers. In a market that is already in the midst of a severe driver shortage, a reduction in driver&rsquo;s hours would be devastating and extremely expensive for shippers, carriers, and consumers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Electronic on board recorders (EOBR)-<\/strong>&nbsp; There is a potential legislation that would require all carriers to install EOBR in their trucks to replace their paper log books. Currently, log books are utilized by drivers to record their on\/off duty times.&nbsp; It is widely believed that drivers take certain liberties with their paper log books that allow them to drive a few extra miles. However if EOBR legislation is passed when a driver reaches his allotted hours he will lose his ability to drive. If the driver continues to drive without hours then this will have a negative impact on the driver&rsquo;s CSA score. There has also been talk of the EOBR being connected to law enforcement.&nbsp; The FMSCA currently is requiring carriers\/drivers in certain cases to install an EOBR as part of their corrective action required and many carriers are also proactively installing EOBR devices to regulate their drivers.&nbsp; In my opinion EOBR would be the biggest game changer to the transportation industry since the trucking industry was deregulated in 1979. Every minute that a driver has to drive will become more valuable and the penalty for holding a driver up will also become more substantial. Detention charges will most likely go up and will be charged after a short window. Stop off charges on multi-stop loads will also go up.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe bottom line is that transportation costs are going up and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Carriers are in control of the market and chances are you need them more than they need you. The good news is there are things that you can do to offset the cost increases you are seeing on your freight spend. A good place to start is to review your transportation personnel, process and technology. If the people handling your transportation do not know what CSA is then you have room for improvement. If your processes for handling transportation have not been reviewed or updated recently then you should probably take a look at them since the transportation market has gone through several major shifts in the last four years. If you are using spreadsheets, faxes, emails, and phones to manage your freight you may want to look at some transportation specific technology. Your ability to quickly load and unload carriers will become extremely important going forward. The bottom line is that you need carriers as much if not more than they need you right now. The shippers that treat their carriers as a valued partner will be able to overcome the challenges of the transportation market.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"259","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"LTL Carriers: Rate increases and what they mean for your business","url_title":"ltl-carriers-rate-increases-and-what-they-mean-for-your-business","entry_date":"1314907920","exerpt":"Over the last few weeks, LTL (less than truckload) carriers have begun announcing general rate increases.

First, they are managing their capacity as the demand for their equipment increases. Second, it&#39;s a clear attempt to improve their earnings, reversing the losses most of them incurred at some time over the last few years.

These rate increases are not something that is limited to the full truckload segment of the industry.&nbsp; Intermodal rates have increased in the last few years as well.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIntermodal shipping rates have gone up to reflect the increase in demand for this service.&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing a decline in volume during the recession, intermodal business has bounced back in the last 18 months.&nbsp; Many months have shown double digit increases in month over month volumes.&nbsp; Small increases in the economy and the tightening of the truck market have been the driving force behind the resurgence of intermodal business.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The increases in general intermodal rates have not been as high as truckload rates and have probably averaged between 3%-6%<\/strong>.&nbsp; However, during peak intermodal (rail shipments) season, usually between late August and December, rates will spike and capacity becomes very limited.&nbsp; Intermodal shipping is considered a less costly alternative to over the road transportation and many times rate increases are kept in check.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMany times intermodal shipping will prove to be a cheaper alternative to over the truckload shipping on the front end, but you need to be aware of the accessorials involved with intermodal.&nbsp; Detention in the intermodal world will usually be applied after less waiting time and is typically more expensive than with over the road transportation.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe costs in the less than truckload (LTL shipment) market have also gone up.&nbsp; <strong>LTL carriers have been raising their rates by 5%-7% per year over the last two years and there are rumors that some LTL carriers will be taking another increase in early 2012.&nbsp;<\/strong> If certain LTL carriers do take another rate increase in February it would be the 4th rate increase in about 24 months.&nbsp; Several major LTL carries have also taken steps to reduce their fleet size by consolidating operations and closing terminals.&nbsp; These actions have reduced capacity, which has helped the LTL carriers justify their repeated cost increases.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLine haul rates are only a part of cost increases that you are paying to move your freight.&nbsp; Fuel surcharges have almost returned to their pre-recession levels.&nbsp; In the summer of 2008 we saw the average cost of diesel reach $4.76 per gallon.&nbsp; In May of 2011 it was up to an average of $4.12 on per gallon. Most fuel surcharges are either based on a percentage of the line haul or per-mile based on the cost of fuel.&nbsp; For instance, if the average price of fuel was $3.851 your percentage would be 28.5% or $.046 per mile.&nbsp; In this example the percentage would go up .5% for every $.049 that the fuel price goes up.&nbsp; The per-mile FSC would go up $.01 for every $.06 that the cost of fuel went up.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo if average price of fuel went up to $3.93 next week then your percentage would be 30% or you would be paying $.047 per mile.&nbsp; If you take into account that fuel prices are up about $.90 from where they were at this time last year you are paying 18% or $.15 more in FSC depending whether your FSC is based on percentage or per mile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These line haul and FSC increases previously mentioned refer to contractual rates.&nbsp; If your pricing comes from the spot market you have probably seen much larger increases.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf your company buys transportation on the spot market you have probably seen your rates increase by as much as 25% in the last two years. I would strongly recommend that you look into moving away from the spot market if at all possible.&nbsp; The spot mark costs you more in the long run.&nbsp; Most spot market rates are given with line haul and fuel surcharge combined into a flat rate.&nbsp; Many times this means the total cost is rounded up to a whole number.&nbsp; This is a big difference from contractual rates with a varying fuel surcharge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s say you had a dry load moving from Chicago to Boston and contractual rate was $1.50 per mile on 990 miles with a fuel surcharge of $.35 per mile.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tYour total cost would be $1831.50.&nbsp; If you asked for a spot market quote on that load your rate maybe $1850.&nbsp; If you are looking for a truck in a difficult market or maybe you need a load moved on a Friday your quote could be as high as $2,200 for that same lane.&nbsp; The idea of requesting a spot market rate is to get the lowest rate possible for that one load.&nbsp; However, many times you can get a rate from a transportation provider, but that does not necessarily mean that you can the truck you need for the rate.&nbsp; In the current market you need to be worried about getting the freight moved first and the cost second.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe cost of transportation is going up and many of the factors driving the increases are out of your control.&nbsp; However, there are many things that you can do to offset these cost increases.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t\tLook into making your processes more efficient.&nbsp; If you can streamline processes you can save time and increase the productivity of your staff.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tIncorporate technology into your transportation.&nbsp; Email and spreadsheets can do many wonderful things, but they are not the best tools available to manage transportation.&nbsp; Many companies have ERP systems that may have transportation functionality available or you can look into a Transportation Management System (TMS).<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tInvest in transportation industry training for your team members that are responsible for moving your freight.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many transportation industry events and associations that can be a great resource for your team members.&nbsp; Even subscribing to transportation trade publications can be a big help.&nbsp; If you are not spending money on the front end to make sure your people know what is going on in the transportation market you will end up paying more in rate increases and transportation service failures on the back end.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tLook into outsourcing your transportation.&nbsp; If your transportation is handled by someone without a transportation title, such as someone in customer service, sales or purchasing you may want to explore the benefits of outsourcing your transportation to a 3PL.&nbsp; Allow your employees to focus on their main responsibilities and allow transportation experts to help you streamline your processes, incorporate technology, and manage your costs.<\/li>\n<\/ol>"}, {"ID":"261","cat_name":"Truckload","title":"What Management Needs to Know about the Transportation Market, Part 1: Capacity","url_title":"what-management-needs-to-know-about-the-transportation-market-part-1-capaci","entry_date":"1314044400","exerpt":"Transportation may not be high on your priority list or even on your list at all, but you should probably make some room for it.

I know that many companies view transportation as a cost of doing business, but if you are not aware of what is going on in the transportation market then you probably have not been able to make the necessary changes to keep your costs in line.&nbsp; In general, your transportation costs should be between 3%-8% of your sales. Anything higher than 8% means that your transportation spend is probably cutting into your bottom line.&nbsp; If you do not have a lot of free time to spend learning about transportation, but you want to be aware of what is going on in the market, then you should focus on&nbsp; these 3 main areas&mdash;capacity, costs, and legislation.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Part One: Capacity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tCapacity is the biggest factor that any company should be concerned about. Currently there is a major shortage of equipment as a result of the great recession. Between 2007-2010 over 5,000 trucking companies went out of business and over 380,000 trucks were taken off of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is about 7,900 less trucks available on average per day in the 48 continental states.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain segments have been hit harder such as flatbed, while other segments such as tankers have not been hit as hard.&nbsp; But overall capacity is not where it needs to be to meet the current demand and all indicators point to it getting worse.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDrivers are also in short supply.&nbsp; Many drivers have reached the retirement age and have\/will be leaving the driver pool.&nbsp; In addition to retiring drivers, many drivers are being forced off of the road by the new CSA regulations. CSA went into effect in 2010 and we have only just started to feel the potential impact. As a result, many trucking companies are looking to replace drivers that they have lost and are not in a position to expand.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with a 9% unemployment rate carriers are still struggling to recruit new drivers into the industry.&nbsp; Being a professional truck driver is not a career for everyone and many people are not interested in a job that may require them to live in a truck for weeks at time. As a result many trucking companies have started to offer sign on bonuses to try and attract new drivers. They are also offering bonuses to try and lure experienced drivers away from the competition.&nbsp; These bonuses will eventually be passed on to shippers as part of their line haul rates.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe same scenario is true on the equipment side. During the recession many carriers had to hold onto tractors and trailers longer than they normally would because they could not afford to replace them.&nbsp; However, most carriers are now in a position to replace their older equipment and this sudden spike in demand for new tractors and trailers has been met with mixed emotions.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMany truck and trailer manufactures reduced their production capacity during the last several years and are now struggling to meet the demand for new equipment.&nbsp; As a result there is a 6-9 month backup for new equipment orders.&nbsp; The spike in manufacturing of new equipment has also been slowed by a lack of raw materials. The sudden demand and short supply for certain raw materials is causing the price of new equipment to go up&mdash;another cost that will be absorbed by shippers.&nbsp; Keep in mind that this surge is being led by a push to replace aging equipment and not by a push to expand fleet size.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, even if a carrier wanted to add 100 tractors to their fleet they cannot just go to the dealership and pick them up.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMany carriers are not interested in expanding their fleets because the current capacity situation allows them to control the market and generate their desired profit per truck for the first time in several years.&nbsp; Most publicly traded carriers have been reporting great earnings in 2011.&nbsp; http:\/\/wallstcheatsheet.com\/stocks\/transportation-stocks-delivering-explosive-earnings-growth.html\/.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tA few quick actions you can take to see what impact transportation is having on your bottom line.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDetermine what % transportation is of your total sales.&nbsp; Examine your historical data using an average over a period of time in order to establish a benchmark. We&#39;d be happy to help you make some changes to your processes\/personnel that can save you some money.<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t&nbsp;Examine the way drivers are being treated when they come to your facility.&nbsp; Many drivers have final say on which loads they haul and one of the factors that they will use to determine what loads they take or don&rsquo;t take is past experience at the pick up or delivery location.&nbsp; If drivers are treated well and get loaded\/unloaded quickly then drivers will accept loads that involve your location. They may even request your freight.&nbsp; However, if drivers are treated poorly and&nbsp; have to wait a long time to be&nbsp; loaded\/unloaded then you will be paying more to get carriers to come to your facilities, paying detention when you hold them up or even risk drivers refusing loads that involve your company.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>\n\tFor more on capacity, visit our blogs:<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want a rate or do you want a truck?<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a carrier&rsquo;s world part 2: Drivers wanted<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a carrier&rsquo;s world<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carrier capacity: Look beyond the bid<\/p>\n<p>\n\tStay tuned for the next installment of this blog when we talk about cost increases in the transportation market<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"262","cat_name":"Trinity Foundation","title":"Trinity Supports Military Heroes Fund","url_title":"trinity-supports-military-heroes-fund","entry_date":"1312921440","exerpt":"On August 4-5th, Trinity participated in Innospec Fuel Specialties\u2019 annual Golf Tournament.

So what\u2019s the better option?  It depends on a few factors.","content":"<p>A couple weeks ago I had family visiting from out of town, so we decided to go to the beach. Even though the outside temperature was 95 degrees with a heat index of.. .oh I dunno&hellip;400 or so, the water temp was surprisingly chilly. After playing in the sand with my niece for about an hour, I needed a dip in the ocean to cool off. Was I going to do an all-out David Hasselhoff a la Baywatch dive into the water, or would I dip my toes into the water, slowly immersing myself? I went the latter route, slowly entering the water like a wimp until a nice big wave decided it was tired of waiting for me to get wet.<\/p>\n\n<p>When it comes to transportation management software (TMS) deployment, companies are often wondering whether they should dive in head first, or test the waters with one or two facilities before completely soaking themselves with a full-scale implementation.&nbsp; So what&rsquo;s the better option?&nbsp; It depends on a few factors.<\/p>\n\n<p>First of all, how deep is your knowledge of your current transportation processes across locations\/divisions? Just because each distribution or warehouse location is part of the same company, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they share the same transportation processes. If you have a strong understanding of the processes of warehouses 1 and 2, but warehouses 3 and 4 are anybody&rsquo;s guess, then it may be best to test the waters with just facilities 1 and 2. If you&rsquo;ve already taken the time to map out the processes for all locations, then you may be ready for a full-scale approach.<\/p>\n\n<p>The other thing to consider is the level of buy-in from all identified stakeholders in the TMS deployment. Are they all for the new system and accompanying improvements in processes, or are they dead-set on keeping things the way they are? If you&rsquo;ve only received buy-in from key personnel at one or two locations, then it may be best to test deployment at those facilities. Chances are that a successful deployment at one or two locations will help you get that much needed buy-in from those facilities that are the main resistors to change.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\n<p>Finally, you&rsquo;ll need to consider whether the technology can support a phased deployment approach. Is the transportation management software flexible enough to get additional locations up-and-running quickly after initial implementation at your test warehouses? Is it customizable enough to support the differences in processes across locations? Can the technology vendor or 3PL provide the flexible service options and pricing structures that are needed to support a phased approach? The answers to these questions will have an effect on your ability to test the technology at select locations.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are just a few things to consider when deciding whether you should take a full-scale approach to TMS deployment, or whether it may be better to first test the waters. An analysis of your internal processes, levels of buy-in from company personnel, and review of system capabilities will help you select the best approach.<\/p>\n\n<p>By the way, the next time you&rsquo;re at the beach... keep an eye on those waves.<\/p>\n<div id=\"slidebox\">\n\t<a class=\"close\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/request-a-consultation?utm_source=SlideInCTA&amp;utm_medium=TMSWadeorDiveBlog&amp;utm_campaign=CTA\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}TMS-slidein.jpg\" style=\"width: 90%; height: auto; border: none;\" \/><\/a><\/div>"}, {"ID":"264","cat_name":"Trinity Foundation","title":"\"Putt Fore Life\" Golf Tournament","url_title":"putt-fore-life-golf-tournament","entry_date":"1311625800","exerpt":"The 8th Annual \u201cPutt Fore Life\u201d Golf Tournament will be held August 27th at Sussex Pines Golf Course in Georgetown, Delaware, with a tee time at 10 a.m.  The tournament is a charity event to raise money for the Trinity Foundation, a non-profit organization founded in 2005 by the employees of Trinity Transport, Inc.

However, these days it&rsquo;s very trendy, and a successful agent has dozens if not hundreds of options on whose shingle they can hang outside their door.&nbsp; This article encompasses what I feel a good, solid, professional Transportation Brokerage Agent should look for in the company they want to partner and entrust their livelihood with.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ten things you should consider when deciding which Transportation Brokerage\/3PL to partner with:<\/p>\n\n<h2>1.&nbsp;<strong>Culture.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Culture is everything.&nbsp; How are you made to feel when you walk through the doors or when someone answers your call or email, warm and fuzzy, or cold and prickly?&nbsp; The way you are made to feel is a direct reflection on how your customers and carriers will feel when they interact with your company.<\/p>\n\n<h2>2.<strong> Financial stability.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t take for granted, and definitely don&rsquo;t take the headhunter recruiter&rsquo;s word for it, that your prospect company is financially sound.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask them to see the following (you have every right to see this information):<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Income statement:&nbsp; This gives you a snapshot of how efficiently the company is being run.&nbsp; Are they in the black or the red?&nbsp; Are they not only profitable, but delivering a healthy profit?<\/li>\n\t<li>Balance sheet:&nbsp; If the income statement is a physical, then the balance sheet is a full body CT scan.&nbsp; How much debt and equity do they have?&nbsp; Is it a healthy debt to equity ratio?&nbsp; Are the owners re-investing the profit back into the company in retained earnings and reserves?&nbsp; Or, are they pilfering all of the profit?<\/li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;How much operating capital (cash) do they have?&nbsp; It takes a lot of cash to float a multi-million dollar receivable, often for weeks at a time.&nbsp; Banks are becoming increasingly vigilant in ensuring the institutions they loan to have the collateral and the viability to warrant a large line of credit.&nbsp; Banks will pull financing &ndash; one day there, next day gone.<\/li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;A current Dunn and Bradstreet report on their company: &nbsp;this is the financial scorecard that people you do business with will be looking at.<\/li>\n\t<li>&nbsp;How do they handle accounts receivable?&nbsp; Do they keep their delinquencies at a manageable level?&nbsp; Are their collectors well trained, professional, and courteous?&nbsp; Or is their A\/R strung out and poorly managed?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>3. <strong>Additional services<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>In order to stay competitive in today&rsquo;s market, a broker agent must be able to offer his or her customer more than just domestic, spot market trucks that pick up at point A and deliver to point B.&nbsp; You need to be educated to offer viable solutions for your customers logistics challenges, to include multiple modes of shipping.&nbsp; Your competitors are offering solutions, so you need to be positioned to do so as well (for additional info on being a Logistics Solutions Provider (LSP), read my blog <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/secret-to-success\">&lsquo;Secret to Success &ndash; Becoming an LSP&rsquo;<\/a>).&nbsp; Services you should expect your prospect broker company to provide you and your customers:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Domestic, Canadian and Mexican truckload services<\/li>\n\t<li>Conventional LTL pricing with nationally recognized carriers, &nbsp;both spot market and customer specific tariff pricing<\/li>\n\t<li>Wholesale door to door intermodal service<\/li>\n\t<li>Door to door international shipping service<\/li>\n\t<li>Logistics outsourcing \/ consulting and Software As A Service (SAAS) Transportation Management Systems (TMS), high-level logistics management solutions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>4. <strong>Risk Averse \/ Risk Prone.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Companies in the 3PL \/ transportation brokerage industry in this day and age must be able to balance their risk, especially since the definition of risk has changed drastically in the past few years.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Risk averse companies tend to shy away from opportunities that may have some risk associated with them (difficult lanes and commodities or a customer with a less than perfect credit history).<\/li>\n\t<li>Risk prone companies throw caution to the wind every day and will do business with anyone, anywhere, anytime, regardless of the risk associated with them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>You should look for a company that finds the &lsquo;sweet spot&rsquo;, a healthy combination of risk averse and risk prone.&nbsp; You can do this by asking them the right situational questions.<\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">5. <strong>Reputation.<\/strong>&nbsp; <\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">This is a \"very small\", large industry we work in.&nbsp; Word travels fast with customers and carriers if a broker has shady practices.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Look the prospect company up on the credit reporting sites with the major load posting services.&nbsp; What is their average days to pay?&nbsp; How are they ranked?<\/li>\n\t<li>Make sure they are a TIA (Transportation Intermediaries Association) member and check them out on the TIA&rsquo;s watchdog service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>6. <strong>Claims, bad debt liability, account ownership, and binding contracts.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Who will assume the liability and what are your obligations if something goes wrong?<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If the broker approves the credit, do they accept the liability if a customer goes belly up and doesn&rsquo;t pay their bill?&nbsp; Or do they push the liability back on the agent?<\/li>\n\t<li>If a legitimate claim happens and it&rsquo;s no fault of the agent, does the broker accept liability or do they push all the liability back on to the agent and the carrier?<\/li>\n\t<li>All too often I see agents that are locked into binding contracts with companies, that wrongly create non-competes \/ non-solicits against the agents&#39; customers.&nbsp; Agents should steer clear of any contracts that bind them to a company for a determined amount of time or which may prevent an agent from working with their own customers.&nbsp; The nature of a freight broker agent is that of an independent contractor and you should be free to move your business uninhibited with no obligations to any company.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>7. <strong>Carrier compliance policies.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to litigation and tying liability for a carrier&rsquo;s actions back to a broker or shipper, the game has changed significantly in recent years.&nbsp; It is extremely important that the prospect company have stringent carrier compliance policies and the technology in place to ensure they have accurate information on each carrier at all times.&nbsp; A sizeable broker&rsquo;s carrier list can exceed 50,000 active carriers, so the workload and logistics of managing this database is immense, but critically important that it&rsquo;s 100% accurate and up to date at all times.<\/p>\n\n<h2>8. <strong>Operating system.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>A good, solid, and intelligent operating system will not only serve as an order entry system for you, but it will give you the tools you need to make intelligent business decisions, streamline your workflow, and improve efficiency in your office.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Does their operating system protect your confidential customer information from other agents or offices within the company?<\/li>\n\t<li>Does their operating system give you the tools to analyze current lane analysis, historical carriers, pricing and allow multiple modes of shipping (truckload, LTL, intermodal, international, etc) ?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>9. <strong>Commission rates.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Beware of the &ldquo;snake oil&rdquo; sales tactics of headhunter recruiters offering high commissions.&nbsp; Many of these recruiters are commission based, and are very aggressive in their recruiting efforts.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s too good to be true, it probably is.&nbsp; Ask a lot of questions about their commission settlements; are there any hidden charges or fees?&nbsp; What is their chargeback policy?&nbsp; Ask to see all of this in writing, and make certain its part of your contract.&nbsp; Spoken promises are impossible to uphold. A good rule to live by is if it&rsquo;s not in writing, it never happened. Get it in ink!<\/p>\n\n<h2>10.&nbsp; <strong>What&rsquo;s the plan?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>A well managed and efficient company that is sustainable and has what it takes to survive the challenges of our industry, will know how to ride out the ebbs and flows of our complex economy and will have a plan.&nbsp; It should be a good plan that is forward thinking, looking out six months, a year, and five years.&nbsp; Ask to see their plan, read it, and draw your own conclusions.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Does it revolve around solving yesterday&rsquo;s problems?<\/li>\n\t<li>Does it revolve around looking into the future, being innovative, and blazing the trail?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The transportation and logistics brokerage industry has been plagued for many years with people and organizations that run unscrupulous or unethical operations, but there are also solid and ethical companies in our industry.&nbsp; This article was written to help the serious and professional transportation broker agent make the best decision on which company to align with and to call your home.

Here are some of the factors you should consider when organizing your own structure. These will help ensure you&#39;re seeing an accurate portrayal of your selected providers&#39; service in order to make the most informed decisions when routing freight.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Do they own a clock?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tHow much did you have to fork out in overtime pay to dock workers when the truck showed up past shipping hours for the pickup? Think about when that delivery you were expecting for your \"just-in-time\" facility came in so late that your assembly line was shut down. How much labor and lost production was wasted waiting on the truck?&nbsp; Tally up the revenue lost when your customer cancelled the order they&#39;d been waiting too long on. Don&#39;t forget the dollar figures associated with your customer&#39;s satisfaction, especially if you&#39;ve actually lost customers due to a trucking company&#39;s problematic reliability. It will hurt to see it, but go ahead and calculate the lifetime value of that client and factor that into your metrics when measuring shipping services.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The invoice says how much more?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tYou agreed to a price, but the invoice arrives, and guess what? It&#39;s different than what you agreed upon! Hidden fees, overcharges, and billing errors are often overlooked as metrics used to analyze a carrier performance, but they are important to monitor. If a carrier has provided a rate sheet or a quote which positions them deceptively lower than the competition only to hit you with extra accessorial fees, you may have been better off working with the other carrier who submitted a higher price, delivered on time, and submitted a correct invoice. Don&#39;t panic if you lack the structure to perform freight bill audits, there are reputable companies out there who can perform this service for you, often at a percentage of savings cost. Trinity&#39;s Customized Logistics division can audit freight bills utilizing our TMS, generating customized reports as needed to show where discrepancies are occurring.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Excuses, excuses!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tHow many different types have you heard? \"I can&#39;t deliver today because our truck is in the shop, we have to repower it\" or \"It&#39;s snowing too hard, we can&#39;t get over there today\" or \"The driver is sick, we&#39;ll have to reassign the load\". What would you consider to be a \"service failure\"? A breakdown, a missed pickup, a slipped delivery appointment, damaged product? All of the above? It&#39;s important to define what your company considers to be a true failure in a trucker&#39;s service record. Once you define it, you can measure it. That means when you are selecting the provider for a critical shipment, you&#39;ll be able to see a proven record of success or failure, choosing accordingly to ensure the highest chance for a successful delivery to your customer, no excuses required.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>You&#39;ll get more flies with sugar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tYour brand is a promise, and the people you hire to deliver the product are extensions of the promise, and extensions of your brand. That&#39;s why the professionalism and courtesy of the shipping service provider you choose is paramount to the successful delivery of your brand&#39;s promise to your customer. Anyone who shows up on behalf of your company can leave an impactful impression in the way they carry themselves. If they&#39;re pleasant, appreciative for the freight opportunity, and eager to serve the needs of both your staff and those they meet during delivery to your customer, that behavior should be rewarded with more of your business. Track positive feedback on drivers as much as you track negative remarks, each carry significant weight in the end score.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Cracked, leaking, or plain out busted<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tOverages, shortages, and damages to the product aren&#39;t always the transportation provider&#39;s fault. Bear in mind, these comments are only directed when the driver is to blame after you&#39;ve investigated all evidence. Whether it is inbound materials for your facility or outbound from your facility, it&#39;s never good to receive product that&#39;s been damaged by actions of the driver. By tracking the instances, you can spot trends with specific drivers and the motor carriers they represent. By learning who travels with the most special care of your \"precious cargo,\" you can make better decisions about who&#39;s getting your business.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor more information on measuring carrier performance, contact Trinity Logistics at <strong>(866) 603-5679<\/strong>.

","content":"<p>\n\tHave you ever wondered what a freight broker is, what they do, why they exist? To put it in simple terms, freight brokers are simply matchmakers. They are the middle-man between the shipper (the maker or owner of the product) and the trucking company that moves the freight. Freight brokers perform a valuable service for both ends of the spectrum, however they do not function as an actual carrier, they arrange for the transport of goods. Freight broker activities are under the jurisdiction of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) who defines a broker as &ldquo;a person who, for compensation, arranges, or offers to arrange, the transportation of property by an authorized motor carrier&rdquo;.&nbsp; 49 C.F.R. Part 371<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFreight brokerages provide assistance to carriers by filling their trucks and providing assistance along the route to help the trucker deliver the order on time. Not every carrier has a private sales force working to secure loads for their fleet, and needs help accessing a network of shippers quickly to keep them rolling. Brokers also provide a great financial service to truckers, providing fuel advances to help with cash flow and offering quick payment plans. Oftentimes, the carrier is paid before the freight broker collects payment from the shipper! Bottom line, a freight broker exists to help the carriers relocate their equipment to a better freight market, or in many cases, back to their home base.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMany companies find the services provided by freight brokers to be an important link in their supply chain. The importance of a freight broker is easy to understand; the freight broker makes sure that the shipments are arranged to deliver on time at a fair price with reputable providers. Without freight brokers, shippers would encounter an enormous investment of time and money trying to find the right carrier to transport their products, tracking the shipment, and auditing freight bills.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTrinity Transport, ranked by Transport Topics as one of the top 25 freight brokerages in the nation since 2003, moves an average of 15,000 loads per month. With that type of volume, we carry significant buying power and relationships with our motor carriers. That translates into savings on each shipment that the shippers may not be able to obtain based on their volume alone. Trinity saves their clients and motor carriers a great deal of time playing matchmaker, our goal is not only to deliver your product on time, but also to deliver time itself so that you can perform at your best without having to become experts at matching loads to trucks or vice versa. Allow Trinity to take a load off of your mind, contact us for a free quote on your shipment or for information on our load boards.

Not only are shippers paying a higher fuel surcharge than they did last year, but they also have to pay higher line haul rates.  This is a result of an increase in demand for trucks and a decrease in the supply of both trucks and drivers.  Right now there are fewer trucks on the road than there were last year.  However, carriers have more freight to choose from, which is not a good thing for shippers.

At some point you will have to try and pass these costs onto your customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the better option is to get creative and find ways to become more efficient and find cost savings throughout your transportation processes instead of just trying to reduce your freight rates.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shipper that can absorb these increases in transportation costs without passing them onto their customers will have an advantage over their competition.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI recommend that you take a look at your processes, technology, and personnel.&nbsp; If you are doing things the same way you have always done them, than there is probably some room for improvement.&nbsp; The transportation market has gone through 3 major changes in the last 3 years alone and most companies have had to make significant changes to their processes to keep costs down.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs efficient as most companies believe their processes to be, transportation is generally one area that is overlooked.&nbsp; Many companies view their freight spend as a cost of doing business and therefore do not spend enough time reviewing their transportation processes.&nbsp; However, in the transportation market we are in, that cost of doing business is going up and companies can no longer afford to overlook their transportation department.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf the only technology you are using to manage your transportation is a combination of a fax machine, spread sheets, and email, then you probably have some room for process improvement and the ability to at least create soft cost savings.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf transportation is handled by someone who does not have a transportation title such as customer service, sales, or by someone in purchasing, than you probably have some room for process improvement and cost savings.&nbsp; If you are asking your customer service team to become rate shoppers and handle the transportation, which is a full time job in this market, when do they have time to provide customer service?&nbsp; When people become over whelmed they are going to try and get things done, not necessarily get them done correctly.&nbsp; Your company may think that they are saving money because they did not hire a transportation person, but they are most likely costing themselves money because they are not maximizing the productivity of the customer service team.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI would also recommend that companies take a look at the transportation expertise of the people handling their freight.&nbsp; People only know what they have done or been taught and if the people making transportation decisions for your company do not have a lot of experience or exposure to transportation information outside of your company then you probably have room for improvement.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tKeep in mind, there are many 3pls and transportation consultants that can help you and your company create cost saving solutions if you do not have the time or resources to do it internally.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"275","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Top 3 Reasons to Partner with a 3PL","url_title":"top-3-reasons-to-partner-with-a-3pl","entry_date":"1308596640","exerpt":"Learn what to look for and how to choose the correct 3rd Party Logistics Provider, and see why Trinity is the correct choice!","content":"<p>\n\tLearn what to look for and how to choose the correct 3rd Party Logistics Provider, and see why Trinity is the correct choice!<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yrEt1Y1XBmQ?feature=player_embedded\" width=\"640\"><\/iframe><\/p>"}, {"ID":"277","cat_name":"Company Culture","title":"New Rules for Success (Part 2)","url_title":"new-rules-for-success-part-2","entry_date":"1307387760","exerpt":"Learn about the new rules for success from our President\/CEO, Jeff Banning.","content":"<p>\n\t<strong>11. Real Relationships Rule<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tSuccessful transportation professionals continue to believe that this is a people business.&nbsp; Relationships must be cultivated not only with customers and carriers, but also with colleagues within the company &ndash; in the headquarters office and out in the field with agents, sales associates, or company stores. I firmly believe in the 3R&rsquo;s - Real Relationships Rule.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>12. Train to improve performance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tTraining will always be a high priority in a successful company.&nbsp; Training helps people to perform at their best.&nbsp; Good performance boosts self worth.<br \/>\n\tA sense of worth builds employee loyalty to the team, the company, the customer and the carrier.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>13. Give back to the world around you<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tTo be successful today requires a culture of caring not only for the company, but its community and the world outside.&nbsp; A company and its employees must be willing to give back &ndash; to donate time, money, ideas and energy to others.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>14. Do it right, but also &ndash; do the right thing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tI believe a successful company needs to create a culture that allows team members to address their jobs with complete integrity and morality &ndash; not only to do it right, but to do the right thing.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>15. Set goals that people can commit to achieving<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tAlong with everything else, leadership beliefs have changed. Today, the characteristic that sets leaders apart from those less successful is not ambition.<br \/>\n\tIt&rsquo;s neither intelligence nor charisma or personality.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s certainly not luck.<br \/>\n\tThe valued leader today is one with the ability to set goals that people can become committed to achieving.&nbsp; It is the person who is consistent in involving, rewarding and recognizing people.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>16. Nurture and create nurturing leaders<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tA company must cherish and nurture their real asset, and that is the people who comprise a company.&nbsp; You must be a model of the kind of leaders you want to inspire and develop.&nbsp; Provide leadership training.&nbsp; Create pathways to success and leadership for those within the ranks.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>17. Show appreciation of others &ndash; every day<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tTo succeed today, it&rsquo;s really very simple.&nbsp; You must get better and better each and every day, create an environment of high tech and high touch and every day, appreciate and reward the people who make it work.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>18. Constantly reward and recognize good work<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tEvery great company, every great brand, and every great career has been built in exactly the same way.&nbsp; Bit by bit, step by step, and little by little.&nbsp; If every element of an organization, and every person, gets a little better every day, then that organization will become unstoppable. As a leader you must recognize your team members&rsquo; good work and reward their relentless pursuit of excellence in order to keep that momentum! What gets rewarded gets done, and what gets done builds growth.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>19. Be a source of pride for each employee<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tAn organization that builds this kind of momentum will soon evolve into a market leader.&nbsp; It will be successful and profitable.&nbsp; And most important, it will be a source of pride for each and every person it employs.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>20. A company is simply a group of people; take care of the people<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhat obstacles can you remove for your team? What tools could you provide in order to help them better perform their duties? Get to know them on a personal level, find out what makes them tick, what motivates them, and what de-motivates them as well, and provide incentives accordingly.

Watch for change beyond the obvious<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn order to seize opportunities that lead to success, companies must be ever mindful of changes occurring beyond the obvious.&nbsp; You must continue to be willing to adapt to change since we are living in a constant period of transition.&nbsp; What works today becomes history in a hurry.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. Constantly raise the bar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tSuccessful businesses today don&rsquo;t stop for self-congratulations.&nbsp; They are too busy raising the bar.&nbsp; You must become your own fiercest competitor because no sooner than you cross one frontier, you must be out scouting the next.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. Go way beyond basic services<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tYou can no longer assume that &ldquo;good&rdquo; basic service is enough.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not.&nbsp; You must continually work to dominate your market by improving your processes year after year.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4. Practice continuous improvement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tYou must believe in continuous improvement, always forward thinking and asking yourself daily how you can get better, and then doing something about it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>5. Be creative and innovative<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tYou must be creative and innovative, and more than anything else, this means recognizing and embracing ideas. They may originate anywhere inside the company or out, either can work! The key is to implement these changes quickly&mdash;react to problems and situations spontaneously and correctly&mdash;there&rsquo;s no time to waste.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>6. Enact new ideas quickly<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn this environment, fast can trump careful. That&rsquo;s dangerous.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why the homework must be done in advance, to already have as much information and consideration as possible BEFORE the event.&nbsp; This prepares you to act not only quickly but correctly, as required.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>7. Be willing to take risks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe successful company takes risks, and tries new things.&nbsp; They also watch those innovations and analyze whether they are working.&nbsp; They fine-tune and give it a chance to work, but are also willing to admit when it&rsquo;s not working and try another path.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>8. Have executives and managers who listen and respond<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tManagement and executives must create and maintain a culture that encourages employees to bring ideas into the company.&nbsp; Just as important, they must listen to and consider these ideas.&nbsp; And respond to them - quickly.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>9. Become your own fiercest competitor<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tNo company can afford to ignore change and just do what comes naturally.&nbsp; That may have worked in years past.&nbsp; But those days are in the history books.&nbsp; Competition today is really stiff and we need to use technology to stay out front.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>10.

This will force carriers to scramble to find replacements for drivers that they were not planning on losing.&nbsp; CSA is also going to take many drivers off of the road that had no intention of retiring any time soon.&nbsp; In a country where unemployment is still hovering around 9%, you may think that it will be easy to replace these drivers because so many people are looking for jobs.&nbsp; Well, that is not the reality of the situation.&nbsp; Being a professional truck driver is not for everyone and most people that are accustomed to working a 9 to 5 job and being home in time for dinner will probably not be applying for a CDL anytime soon.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tRetiring drivers and CSA causalities are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a driver shortage.&nbsp; The proposed Hours of Service (HOS) change and the possible requirement of Electronic on-board recorder (EOBR) will severely limit the ability of carriers to service their customers and will require more drivers to move the same amount of freight that is being moved today.&nbsp; If you are keeping score you will notice that there are many factors that are taking drivers off of the road.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs a result of the growing driver shortage, carriers are paying more for their drivers.&nbsp; Some drivers with good CSA scores are taking full advantage of the situation and acting like a superstar free agent in baseball and going to work for the company that will pay them the most.&nbsp; Many carriers are also offering sign on bonus to attract both established drivers as well as first time drivers.&nbsp; Drivers are in such demand that many carriers will give the drivers final say whether or not they take a particular load.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are heading towards a market where carriers are going to make a decision not to service a customer because the driver doesn&rsquo;t want to go to a particular shipper or receiver.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, if you are a shipper you should make your freight and your facilities as carrier friendly as possible.

If you are involved in transportation then you have noticed that it is getting harder to find trucks and that your transportation costs are going up.&nbsp; As the economy continues to slowly recover and as the demand for trucks continues to surpass the supply, it is time to accept the fact that it is a carrier&rsquo;s world.&nbsp; You are going to have to learn to play by their rules and realize that you need them more than they need you.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt was a few short years ago when the majority of the shipping community used the down turn in the economy to put the screws to carriers and drive rates down to levels that had not been seen in more than a decade.&nbsp; As a result thousands of trucking companies went out of business and hundreds of thousands of trucks were taking off of the road for good.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tight credit markets and reduced manufacturing capabilities are impacting the ability of the carrier community to expand their capacity to meet the demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, before they can add additional trucks to their fleets, many carriers need to replace older equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the economic downturn the average age of most fleets increased because many carriers decided not to buy new equipment for various reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than a year of consecutive freight tonnage increases many carriers have felt comfortable enough to spend the money to replace older trucks and some carriers are even feeling good enough to add additional trucks to their fleets.&nbsp; This is a positive sign for the trucking industry, but it is not a quick fix and it may not be a good thing for shippers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMany truck manufactures had to downsize their operations or close plants over the last few years and as a result they may not have the ability to efficiently handle this surge in new truck orders.&nbsp; Currently there is about 6 month backlog for truck manufactures and if orders continue to come in at the current pace then the backlog&nbsp; is expected to grow to about 9 months.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next 6 to 9 months if the economy continues to recover at the current rate there will be will be an increased demand for capacity and the gap between supply and demand will continue to grow.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, if you are a shipper you should make your freight and your facilities as carrier friendly as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be prepared to pay more for less service and prepare your customers for possible service problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is carrier&rsquo;s world and all indication are that it will be that way for the foreseeable future.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"283","cat_name":"Truckload","title":"Load Volume Soars 39%...

If you haven&#39;t felt the pinch, you&#39;re going to soon.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Not Captain Crunch, it&#39;s \"Capacity Crunch\"<\/strong><br \/>\n\tCapacity crunch is industry speak meaning there are fewer trucks available for hire. If you think of capacity as a pool of motor carriers in our country, the crunch occurs when the pool becomes dimished for any reason. For example, the annual produce season affects the capacity pool, soaking up many for hire truckers from March to August as they clamber to haul the higher paying produce loads shifting up the east coast. The difference this year? The crunch started so much earlier (beg of Feb) due to other circumstances in our industry paired with the economic recovery. Other sources call it a driver shortage, but that has more to do with the problem trucking companies are having hiring and affording qualified drivers with clean records.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Load-to-Truck Ratio<\/strong><br \/>\n\tFebruary&#39;s load-to-truck ratio increased by<strong> 62%<\/strong> over January and a whopping <strong>94%<\/strong> over Feb 2010! With freight this abundant, trucking companies are enjoying the pendulum swinging into their favor.Honestly, you can understand (a little) why they are rejoicing. So little is going in their favor these days, what with the rising cost of fuel, increased regulations (CSA), and pending legislation attacks (hours of service and electronic onboard recorders). At least they are able to fill their trucks and keep rolling, unlike the last few years when the number of loads fell drastically. The problem lies with unethical carriers that will essentially auction off their truck to the highest bidder, throwing relationships and customer service to the wind.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>What&#39;s Next?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tDon&#39;t get me wrong, even the most ethical motor carriers are raising prices. You don&#39;t have to be an economics major to know what happens to price when supply doesn&#39;t fulfill demand AND the cost of fuel spikes. Price goes up!

Put quite simply, many carriers are flatly refusing to haul without a substantial amount of fuel surcharge increase.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDRIVER RECRUITMENT is another factor, considering the massive amount of new regulation thrown at trucking companies, including <a href=\"http:\/\/csa.fmcsa.dot.gov\/about\/default.aspx\">CSA<\/a>.

The story in the Northeast and Midwest will not just be wet and windy. A band of snow moved through the Midwest Thursday into Thursday night and is now making its advance through the Great Lakes and interior Northeast today.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSome motor carriers are taking an auction standpoint. They wait out \"booking\" loads to see which shipper or broker will come up to the best bid price for their truck, and then going, going, gone...SOLD to the highest bidder! On the freight forums online, 3PL&#39;s are crying \"foul\" as unethical providers hit below the belt, accepting a shipment, but backing out last minute when a higher paying load comes along. This is the time when REAL RELATIONSHIPS RULE, and it takes a lot of influence with a motor carrier to place their capacity in your hands. But don&#39;t take our word for it, the experts are posting actual indexes showing how the capacity has already tightened, check out our resource information below.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<em>FTR Associates has lowered its Shippers Condition Index (SCI) to reflect tightening carrier capacity, particularly in the truckload sector. The February Issue of FTR&rsquo;s Shippers Update reported that the SCI in January stood at -8.8. The SCI sums up all market influences that affect shippers; a reading above zero suggests a favorable shipping environment, while a reading below zero is unfavorable. January&rsquo;s reading is the most negative (unfavorable) reading for shippers yet seen during the current recovery.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Noel Perry, Senior Consultant for FTR, commented on the forecast for their Shippers Conditions Index &ldquo;The SCI is our method for capturing the shipping environment in one, easy to understand figure.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;The downward progression of the SCI should serve as a warning signal to shippers. While trucking capacity is currently adequate during the normally slack winter shipping season, looking forward we expect things to tighten up dramatically as freight demand picks up beginning in March. A shortage of truck drivers, due in part to new government safety regulations, will be the key factor restricting the ability of motor carriers to expand capacity, resulting in higher rates and possible challenges in getting freight moved later in the year.&rdquo; The February Shippers Update includes commentary on another new federal regulation &ndash; for Electronic On-board Recorders and how they are likely to impact carriers and shippers.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The Shippers Update, launched by FTR Associates during 2010 as a part of the firm&rsquo;s Freight Focus Series, looks at conditions that will affect the cost and efficiency of shipping goods via all transportation modes. North American shippers will find in one reference the essential information they need on freight volumes, equipment capacity and transport costs and rates. The Shippers Update has both history and forecasts for four modal options: truckload, less-than-truckload, intermodal and rail carload. The analysis includes the breakdown of total truck and rail volumes into major commodity segments. It also provides historical snapshots of inland water and air freight markets.

As your trusted source for logistics solutions, we are working to educate our shipping customers, working side by side with them to secure the equipment that will keep their product on the roads and in the hands of their consumers rather than clogging up their dock space, warehouse inventory, and manufacturing lines. Here are some answers to the question everyone is asking...  How To Win the Fight for Capacity   Be Carrier Friendly  It is a carrier's market, friends, and that means you need to become the most carrier friendly shipper possible. Are you doing everything possible to make certain yours is the freight the truckers want to haul? Have you committed your shipping and receiving staff to load and unload trailers as quickly as possible? Are you offering drop trailer programs to the carriers that are able to drop and hook? Another great tactic is to extend your dock hours to become more flexible around peak travel hours, accommodating for traffic patterns and accepting trucks after their last receiver held them up too long. These are three methods to show your appreciation for their valuable time. The less time they spend with you, the more time they can be driving, making money, and accepting more loads (from you!).What about lead time, do you give plenty of advance notice to your carrier\/broker for upcoming shipments? You've got to educate your customers about purchasing with a flexible window of delivery, allowing you ample notice to give a heads up to your providers. The more notice everyone has, the better chance you'll have at securing a truck to deliver on time to the end customer.  It's Time To Commit  Are you committing to your transportation providers, making sure that you're providing them with the volume it takes to become a \"VIP\" in their eyes? Maybe you're one of those that still believe price shopping is the best way to save your company a dollar, dividing your freight among a long list of providers, and patting yourself on the back for finding \"savings\". What do you suppose will happen when your list of providers begin to focus their attention on giving capacity to their bread and butter customers? Unless you become valuable in the eyes of your providers, you could very well be left with a jam-packed dock of freight and no one left to help you win the fight for trucks that's predicted.

At the end of it, do you feel as if you&#39;ve accomplished what you&#39;d set out to do that morning, or did you get sidetracked along the way? Hey, we understand, it happens! Take, for example, when a salesperson asks you to track down their shipment. After spending hours on the phone, you tracked down the late trucker only to step into your next \"to do\" item, getting a rate for a special order. After looking through about 7 different carrier&#39;s rate spreadsheets, you discover it&#39;s a new lane and you begin calling or emailing to get the rate.

Are you making the most of every truck that bumps your dock? Your shipment planning team should be able to analyze current orders and forecast future ones so to build their shipments in the most cost effective manner possible. If you have 1\/2 a truck heading out, yet you&#39;re paying a truckload price, fill the other half with smaller LTL&#39;s and add a stop or two. Sure, the trucker will charge a stop off fee, but undoubtedly you&#39;re going to be saving money overall (so long as the added stop offs are en route and don&#39;t add too many out of route miles). Are you shipping more than a few pallets, ending up in a larger LTL move? Why not encourage the customer to purchase more product to fill the trailer or solicit other business to turn that LTL move into a truckload shipment? Your 3PL (Third Party Logistics) provider should be able to assist you with routing and planning your shipments.

When the ball is in your court, you can measure service performance and rates to ensure your best interests are being cared for.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t4. <em>Increase visibility of your freight.<\/em> Without this, the \"extra\" costs begin to sneak in like stealth monsters to eat away at your bottom line. They slip in undetected because on the front side, you agreed to a set price with the provider. On the backside, however, without the proper visibility of your supply chain, your company incurs expenses from an inability to plan ahead. How about overtime (remember that carrier that showed up an hour late and the dock had to extend their shift to unload the required product?) or late delivery fees (a back charge from your customer thanks to the trucker arriving late for the delivery appointment). My personal favorite is the one that is a true efficiency killer, \"plant downtime\", when the inbound product is so late, the entire manufacturing line shuts down waiting for it. Knowing your freight&#39;s location enables you to prepare effectively to reduce the \"extra\" costs.True visibility is more than having a cell phone to call the driver, it&#39;s using a best in class TMS that enables you to see tracking updates on all of your freight at once. Learn more...<\/p>\n<p>\n\t5. <em>Partner with a freight management team<\/em>.Unless you are a non profit organization, your goal as a company is to turn a decent profit. In the most basic sense, this comes from selling as much product as possible at the highest profit margin possible. Any activity that isn&#39;t directly tied to either securing more business deflects attention away from that goal. That means the countless hours you spend sourcing transportation providers, while tied to customer service, are not considered a profitable way to spend your time. By partnering with a freight management team, you are FREE to do what you do best--SELL! Creating an internal transportation department can drain your resources, clogging up your profit potential with fixed costs. A freight management solution will be able to save you on fixed costs, and will also work to save you on each shipment by leading an official bid process on your shipments, an RFP. Just remember, when selecting your provider, make certain they align themselves so closely with your operations they become part of your team instead of your outsourced vendor. They should not adopt your process, but instead invent solutions to enhance them according to your overall vision.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"289","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Changes to the CSA 2010","url_title":"changes-to-the-csa-2010","entry_date":"1291211280","exerpt":"November has been a whirlwind of changes to the CSA 2010.

I never wrote the 3rd installment to the Unintended Consequences because the first two were written on the premise that it was going to be released without any further changes&hellip;and well, that all changed. In the beginning of the month, Truckinginfo.com released an article written by Oliver B. Patton entitled &ldquo;CSA 2010: Report from the Field&rdquo;. Pilot state carriers spoke out about the vast differences in their Safestat scores vs. the CSA measurements.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTo keep their CSA scores low carriers have found the need to better train drivers and hire or train personnel to inform their shippers. They also realized that the only way to ensure they are not deficient in the fatigued driver category is to utilize electronic on board recorders. One trucking company executive said that they &ldquo;may decline to work with a shipper if the shipper will not cooperate in proper securement&rdquo;. This was reiterated by Scott Andersen, VP of risk management and driver services at Andersen Trucking Service when he said &ldquo;[Our] company also has done customer evaluation to determine which ones will help to keep CSA 2010 scores down.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSince this was not the intention a few days later the FMCSA announced CSA SMS (Safety Measurement System) Improvements. The first revision modified the presentation of the SMS BASIC results. Intended to clarify that carriers who have percentile rankings above the threshold only signify a prioritization for an intervention, not that any kind of safety rating or determination has been made. The second, and more substantial revision was to modify the Cargo-Related BASIC by recalibrating severity weights and to remove the percentiles and intervention status from public view upon roll out (on December 5). Truckers appreciated the change and shippers were left scratching their heads as to how they were supposed to use the information.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNovember 23rd NASTC, the Expedite Alliance of North America, and the Air &amp; Expedited Motor Carriers Association, represented by two lawyers, threatened to file suit against the CSA disclosure. They cited concerns that:<br \/>\n\t&bull; the percentile rankings lead to a &ldquo;public branding of carriers as less than safe&rdquo;<br \/>\n\t&bull; the changes made do not alleviate vicarious liability concerns.<br \/>\n\t&bull; there was no due process or effective way to challenge data at the state and local levels.<br \/>\n\t&bull; A handful of states require probable cause to pull a truck over and therefore issue a significantly larger amount of warnings.<br \/>\n\t&bull; Peer grouping results in unfair comparisons between companies held to different government standards.<br \/>\n\t&bull; 800 technical changes to methodology in August that still have not been released to the public.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOn November 30 the three groups upped the ante by filling a motion for emergency stay with the U.S. Court of Appeals. The organizations say that the BASIC ratings will &ldquo;decrease competition, decrease jobs, and increase transportation costs&hellip;threatening the survival of thousands of carriers, many of which are small companies in rural America.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNovember has lead us to December and today the FMCSA released on its official website that the earliest the &ldquo;national roll-out&rdquo; will occur is December 12, not December 5 as previously assumed. They carefully chose the terminology &ldquo;the earliest&rdquo; just in case&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThis is nowhere close to over and don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for the roll out either.

To continue, let&#39;s take a look at how carriers may attempt to get around this system (whether or not the system is creating the poor scores).<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe new CSA 2010 program is intended to &ldquo;intervene&rdquo; carriers into better safety performances with new measures and tools, however in the official CSA FAQ&#39;s, number 22 reads,<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tQ: \"In the proposed new methodology, how can an Unfit carrier return to service?<\/p>\n<p>\n\tA: The process of a carrier getting back into service once they are determined Unfit is expected to remain the same as today.\"<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHow does an unfit carrier return to service today you may ask? Good question! He or she just applies for a new MC#! After thoroughly reading the &ldquo;New Entrant Safety Assurance&rdquo; on the FMCSA site, which was effective as of February 17, 2009, I have found nothing that says a carrier that was previously put out of service cannot reapply as a new entrant so long as the repairs that put them out of service have been corrected. There is a 17 point safety inspection that makes sure carriers only use drivers with CDL&rsquo;s, drivers that do not have controlled substance violations, and that the company adheres to what we all can only hope is the bare minimum of best business practices.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhat do you think a carrier will do if they are in a state that reports 80-90% of crashes regardless of fault who is meeting the threshold for intervention, thus risking a bad score (blog part 1)? It makes sense for he\/she to just let their insurance expire and reapply for a new MC#, right? The problem for shippers becomes knowing the difference between this carrier and the one who reapplied for an MC# due to actually failing multiple roadside inspections. Most likely the shipper won&#39;t realize the difference until it&rsquo;s too late, and the measure that was supposed to reduce the number of crashes has backfired and allowed the \"crash causers\" to restart with a clean slate.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs if the reasons above were not enough for a carrier to just operate under a new mc#, let me add that drivers are also evaluated under the new system. However, they are not assigned safety ratings, only a violation history of which it is very unclear exactly how the driver is going to be identified.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe drivers&rsquo; violation record does not affect the carriers&#39; data record before or after employment, but will be there for two years regardless of whether they terminate an employee or not. Yet another reason for a carrier to just get out of and then right back into business. They can keep their drivers, whose numbers now do not apply, and the company starts back at 0.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tStayed tuned for our next \"episode\" on how accurate the scores really are in relation to crash causation.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"294","cat_name":"Carriers","title":"New Emissions Regulations Will Affect Truckers...In a Good or Bad Way?","url_title":"new-emissions-regulations-will-affect-truckers...in-a-good-or-bad-way","entry_date":"1288012380","exerpt":"Read about new efficiency regulations.","content":"<p>\n\tThe EPA and the DOT recently announced plans to go ahead with a proposal to require new trucks after 2014 (everything from semi&#39;s to F series Fords) to meet their new efficiency regulations.

You can go to the official CSA 2010 website for that.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I will talk about are the things to worry about if things remain unchanged when CSA is implemented in December. Most of the things you have to be concerned about aren&#39;t being clearly exposed. For example, \"Safety Events&rdquo; reporting will vary greatly from state to state. Under the current SafeStat system, the percent of DOT crashes being reported to the MCMIS ranges greatly. It goes from 80 - 90% in Indiana, Missouri, and Kansas all the way down to less than 30% in Florida and Arizona.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe new regulations count and show all DOT (reported) crashes on a carrier&#39;s report regardless of fault. So, legally parked truck gets hit, suicidal guy runs out into traffic, or any other &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not my fault&rdquo; situations are going to show up on your CSA report and stay there for two years. Get too many of these wrong places at the wrong time, \"sorry Charlie\" incidents, and you can be up for intervention right next to the careless guy who ran into a bunch of those parked trucks.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet&#39;s connect the two, shall we? The new regs report all crashes, and depending on what state you&#39;re in...see what I&#39;m getting at? Like I said, you have something to worry about.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSHIPPERS-Let&#39;s say your primary carrier base runs primarily in one of the states that is going to be reporting their data 80 - 90% of the time. You are going to feel the effects of CSA 2010 a lot harder and faster than if you were using carriers running in the states only reporting 30% of the time. Even if you are doing everything YOU can to make sure you are compliant and choosing the best carriers. Now is the time to ask your carrier base what they are seeing in their Data Preview. Don&#39;t be too hasty to cast aside providers who aren&#39;t scoring A+ on the test. As you&#39;ll read in my future posts, it&#39;s the test that could arguably be wrong.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tCARRIERS-It&rsquo;s a great time to check out your Data Preview on the CSA site.

Everyone expected an overall decrease in capacity as the number of transportation providers realigned with the amount of freight being shipped. What was not so expected was the magnitude with which this tightening continues and the degree it would affect current pricing. So a lot of people are asking themselves-why is capacity still getting so much worse? The simple answer is that we&#39;re still seeing repercussions of the recession play out in the market.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWithout getting into the overwhelming details of why the global economy tanked over the last two years, let&#39;s suffice to say that freight has gone down. In fact, the American Trucking Association listed the Freight Tonnage Index in June 2009 as below its base level set in 2000. However, overcapacity did not balance itself out as carriers operated at or below costs to stay in business, further driving down prices already depressed from the tumbling economy. At the same time, banks held back from collecting on bad debts from insolvent carriers because there was no market for the used equipment the carriers owed on. This was simply not sustainable, and led thousands of carriers to shut down. Many carriers are still holding on just long enough to close their doors with the arrival of this recent tax season.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBut aren&#39;t things starting to turn around? Yes, but herein lies the pricing dilemma. Most leading indicators point towards a bottoming out of the economy, and in several areas a small bounce-back. This small increase in freight, combined with decreasing capacity, is resulting in a pricing market more controlled by the carriers than the shippers (as it&#39;s been in previous years). Furthermore, since many shippers have already renewed their freight bids and budgeted their transportation costs for 2010, they are now finding themselves unable to find trucks to move their freight, especially at the undervalued rates they tried to lock in for the year.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo where are we now? Pricing as a whole is very erratic as both sides try to find a balance, but is increasing at a surprisingly quick rate in many markets. Carriers are desperately trying to make up for some of the losses they&#39;ve endured over the last year while the general public is simply not yet spending enough to allow the businesses to afford it. Service failures and price increases are starting to force shippers that had benefited from the price-shopping discounts of last year to once again turn to service-oriented relationships with providers they know they can count on. Pricing is just a starting point for most of our relationships, but it is the service, communication, understanding, and trust that we build on top of it that will keep us all moving towards a brighter future.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"306","cat_name":"Intermodal","title":"Why Ship Intermodal?","url_title":"why-ship-intermodal","entry_date":"1267109400","exerpt":"One very effective suggestion and service we offer is to move your freight via railways, called \"intermodal\" (rail shipments). In addition to being a more cost-effective method of transporting goods, intermodal services offer many more benefits you may not be aware of.","content":"<p>\n\tHello- My name is John Patton, I am Trinity&#39;s Intermodal Manager. In light of the ever-present desire to cut logistics costs, shippers are looking to companies like Trinity to offer methods to achieve this goal. One very effective suggestion and service we offer is to move your freight via railways, called \"intermodal\". In addition to being a more cost-effective method of transporting goods, intermodal services offer many more benefits you may not be aware of.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFirst of all, the railways offer extra capacity for moving your freight intermodal when the over-the-road trucks are tight, or hard to come by. The intermodal industry continues to add new 53ft containers and chassis to their fleets, whereas many trucking firms are being forced out of business due to the economy. With Trinity as your solutions provider, we are able to tap these additional resources to avoid having your product sit on the dock for days waiting for a truck to come available, which may occur in seasonal periods such as during produce season.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the extra capacity, you will generally see the rail carriers continue to operate in times of inclement weather conditions, while the highway infrastructure is often shut down and thus the over-the-road trucks come to a stand still.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe rail industry has been working hard to reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere. In fact, all rail carriers have a program in place to support the \"green\" initiative in the country. An intermodal train will emit 6.8lbs of carbon emissions for every 100 ton miles compared to an over-the-road truck that emits 19.8lbs. That same intermodal train can move one ton of intermodal freight approximately 830 miles on ONE single gallon of diesel fuel! Trinity Transport, as a provider of this service, fully supports the green initiative, and is a member of the EPA SmartWay Transport Partnership that is committed to reducing carbon imprints annually.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, I&#39;d like to touch on the pure convenience of shipping intermodal. Since Trinity works directly with the draymen (local trucking company) when picking up and delivering your freight, Trinity has a lot more flexibility for accommodating your needs. We also have real-time tracking electronically of the your shipment from the time the load begins till the time the load empties.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are interested in saving money in your transportation budget, helping the environment by going green, finding an extra source of capacity when trucks are tight, and adding convenience and visibility to your shipments, I invite you to contact us for a rate today. It would be our pleasure to serve you, the Trinity Way!<\/p>"}, {"ID":"308","cat_name":"Company Culture","title":"Trinity's Float Named Chamber's Choice in Christmas Parade","url_title":"trinitys-float-named-chambers-choice-in-christmas-parade","entry_date":"1260471480","exerpt":"On Sunday December 6th, Team Trinity participated in the Seaford Christmas parade.

To understand the answer to this question one must accept there are two main economic stimulants to the American economy; namely, consumer spending and government spending. One must also acknowledge America and the world are Debtor Societies. As such, we pay for goods and services not with cash at consumption (point of sale) but through formal or informal promises to pay our debts within specific terms and at specific or variable rates of interest. When the two above economic stimulants stop or slow they invite economic slowdowns. This economic slowdown can introduce economic events such as inflation, recession, deflation and stagflation! Surely, the American public has heard these four words communicated through the media over the past several months.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<br \/>\n\tWhat are inflation, recession, deflation and stagflation? There are several accepted definitions for these four words. Let us deal with the most common definitions and the economic impact they have on our economy.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<br \/>\n\t(1)<strong> Inflation<\/strong> is best defined as a decline in the real value of money that equates to a loss of purchasing power. Inflation is usually brought about by excessive growth in money supply, the printing of money. Therefore, the value of the American currency declines against the world currency. We spend more (cost) for what we want to purchase!<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(2) <strong>Recession<\/strong> is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the Nation&rsquo;s economy, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), for at least two consecutive quarters.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(3) <strong>Deflation<\/strong> is a persistent decrease in the general price level of goods and services but only measured when annual inflation is below zero percent. Deflation should not be confused with a temporary fall in prices; instead, it is a sustained fall in general prices.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t(4) <strong>Stagflation <\/strong>is best defined as a period of rising prices and unemployment but little growth in consumer demand or business activity. There are essentially two causes of Stagflation. First, stagflation can result when an economy is slowed by an unfavorable supply shock such as an increase in the price of oil which trends to raise prices at the same time it slows the economy by making production less profitable. Second, is from inappropriate macroeconomic policies; namely, when central banks cause inflation by permitting excessive growth in money supply and the government simultaneously causes stagflation by excessive regulation of goods market and labor markets (price controls). We recently observed the above Stagflation definitions via recent high prices in a barrel<\/p>\n<p>\n\tof crude oil which resulted in higher gasoline prices. Stagflation is at hand through our government&rsquo;s bailout of select private businesses but at the potential dangerous demise of The Free Enterprise System!<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<br \/>\n\tThere are several adverse economic by-products of the above two stimulant reductions but I will only address two. The first is the erosion of real estate values and equity. The real estate issue is best defined as the reduction of the main asset and economic safety net of all American consumers, the equity in their homes. This man made tragedy has not reach its climax of hardships and no stabilization of real estate values is in sight.<\/p>\n<br \/>\n<p>\n\tHow did R\/E equity erode? For thirty-five years, America depended on the safety and soundness of Fannie Mae that was established as a Federal Agency in 1938. In 1968, Fannie Mae was chartered by Congress as a private stockholder owned company. Fannie Mae is a government sponsored enterprise that provides liquidity and stability to the housing and mortgage markets. Fannie Mae operates in the secondary mortgage markets.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tRather than making mortgage loans direct to the consumer, they work with mortgage bankers, brokers and primary mortgage markets partners to insure funds are available to finance the acquisition of conforming residential mortgages and rental property at affordable costs.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTo insure Fannie Mae is liquidity sound for providing mortgage funds to be lent, they fund their mortgage investments primarily by issuing debt securities in the domestic and international capital markets. Fannie Mae packages their instruments in $500MM increments for sale into the secondary markets. When mortgage lending standards of Fannie Mae was constant, from 1938 through 1968, there was never a problem with home values, required return on investment or a lagging American dollar. Prudent lending and investment standards were wrongly altered in 1972, under the Carter Administration. Mortgage lending standards were further decimated in the 1990s, under the Clinton Administration. President Clinton insisted that banks approve any mortgage loan to<\/p>\n<p>\n\tany borrower. To do so, the value of homes ere artificially increased to meet the loanto value ratio while providing the economic and lending cover to offset down payment and closing cost requirements. This is the main reason home values were artificiallyincreased and the consumer&rsquo;s R\/E equity has subsequently eroded!<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe second issue is overzealous Congressional legislators and legislation! Legislators removed proven real estate lending procedures and replaced them with new socialistic and failed legislation processes. The motivation was to allow everyone to financed a home to live in regardless if they could afford it. This flawed process has resulted in and continues to breed bankruptcies and foreclosures throughout America. The Federal Government legislates how banks must operate from a financial and fiduciary standard of safety and soundness. To stay in compliance with Federal regulations, banks must meet these federal mandates. Sometimes in complying with these mandates, banks forgot the money they lend is not theirs but belonged to depositors, taxpayers and stockholders.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<br \/>\n\tCongressional Legislatures voted to approve The Community Re-Investment Act (CRA), introduced by the Carter Administration. CRA legislation forced banks to approve mortgage loans to low and low\/moderate income families under less qualifying mortgage loan standards than conventional mortgage financing requirements. Need I say more?<\/p>\n<br \/>\n<p>\n\tCRA gave birth to Freddie Mac underwriting standards so non-conforming loans can bepackaged and sold into the secondary mortgage markets much like the Fannie Mae conventional mortgage loans. The Clinton Administration forced more modified open ended poorly conceived credit processes upon the banking industry for the mandatory financing of residential mortgages to low and low\/moderate income families. This new<\/p>\n<p>\n\tlegislation led this Country into a failed and stalled credit crisis which strangles the economic life from balance sheets and income statements of businesses, industries and individuals! These now leveraged banks and other industries are being &ldquo;bailed out&rdquo; by the same government legislators who allowed this economic nightmare to happen. One more point of fact, this &ldquo;bail out concept&rdquo;, if allowed to continue, will destroy the Free<\/p>\n<p>\n\tEnterprise System that has rescued this Country&rsquo;s economy from worse scenarios than we are now facing.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<br \/>\n\tIf these socialistic economic concepts are allowed to continue there will be no recognized difference between excellence and failure. There will be no difference between an excellent worker and a job taker, no difference between telling the truth and telling a lie, and no difference between those who always give that extra effort to succeed in everything of importance to them and those who do not give a darn about how their performance defined them! In short, we will remove the words INCENTIVE and MOTIVATION from the dictionary. America&rsquo;s economy will fall into a &ldquo;Welfare Economy&rdquo; for both individuals and businesses. That is why the final chapter has yet to be written about the American Economy and how it will affect you and me. Stay tuned, America.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"319","cat_name":"Company Culture","title":"Celebrating Our 30th Year","url_title":"celebrating-our-30th-year","entry_date":"1230066240","exerpt":"In 2009, Trinity will celebrate its 30th anniversary, and has recently unveiled its corporate emblem to commemorate the occasion.

This prayer continued daily for about a week, without a confirmation. As we prayed hat night, before going to bed, we asked God for a fleece, to show us the name He wanted us to give<br \/>\n\tthe business we were to venture into? We also asked, in faith, that He would impress upon each of our minds, individually, the name of the business He wanted us to build; at which time we would each write our impression on separate pieces of paper. Neither of us had made any decision at that moment and did not discuss any names until 7 A.M. the next morning, when we each wrote TRINITY TRANSPORT on separate papers. We shouted with joy, thanking God for answering our fleece. There has never been any doubt, then or since, that the name and direction came totally from God!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAfter fifteen years of owning and operating Trinity Transport, Inc., we decided to sell stock in the company to two of our sons. Fifteen years later, all four of our children work for and operate the company, which God gave us in 1979. All the glory goes to God, from whom all blessings flow!<br \/>\n\tAs God founded America in 1776, two hundred years later, He founded Trinity Transport. It took thirty years of growth for this thought to cross our minds. Our family believes in our Nation&rsquo;s motto, &ldquo;IN GOD WE TRUST&rdquo; and have operated His company, the best we know how, with Christian principles. Deana and I are well pleased at the progress our children have made<br \/>\n\tin this business, with God&rsquo;s help, giving Him all the glory!

With a significant decrease in vehicle miles traveled, some 50 billion over the past eight months, gas consumption has decreased, thus reducing the tax revenue.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe U.S. Department of Transportation (&ldquo;DOT&rdquo;) determined that it needed an $8 billion infusion to keep the HTF solvent. In a reversal of policy, President Bush signed legislation transferring the needed $8 billion from the General Fund into the HTF. Funds from the HTF are used to fund transportation projects across the nation and states rely on these funds being paid on a regular basis in order to keep projects on track. While this transfer will keep the HTF from becoming insolvent, it does not resolve the basic funding issue and alternatives must be found.\"<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"322","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Trinity Joins EPA SmartWay Transport Partnership","url_title":"trinity-joins-epa-smartway-transport-partnership","entry_date":"1221250440","exerpt":"Trinity Transport, Inc. has joined the SmartWaySM Transport Partnership, an innovative collaboration between U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the freight industry designed to increase energy efficiency while significantly reducing greenhouse gases and air pollution.

This has made the job of transportation brokers even more difficult.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;It is the main job of a broker to find trucks of all shapes and sizes to move freight for its portfolio of customers,&rdquo; said Dan Dobson, Manager of the New Business Development Unit at Trinity Transport, Incorporated of Seaford.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a lot like e-harmony.com,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re essentially matchmakers.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the job of a matchmaking service is to set up a connection with two parties, the role of a transportation intermediary, such as Trinity, is far more complex. As the &ldquo;middleman,&rdquo; Trinity must try to meet the needs of both its customers and its carriers. This task has become increasingly more difficult with the surge in diesel fuel prices.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSince truckers must pay for their fuel upfront, brokers must try to ensure fair compensation from its customers for these price increases. One way which Trinity tries to take care of the carriers is to provide a fuel surcharge based on current fuel prices.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Dobson, some customers dictate the surcharge; for those who do not, Trinity determines this charge.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tEach week Trinity&rsquo;s marketing department produces a newsletter which contains updated fuel pricing which they receive from the Department of Energy. From these numbers, the surcharge that Trinity offers is determined. As the price of fuel fluctuates, the surcharge does as well. This week&rsquo;s surcharge might be 37% of the line haul (freight rate per mile), which is what Trinity charges the customer. This charge was under 20% a year ago.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDobson said that this surcharge is passed on either as part of a total rate quote to the carrier or as a separate line item to the carriers. Trinity provides its carriers a contract which is broken down into line haul charges, fuel surcharges and any other accessorial charges which could include unloading and stop charges.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also the responsibility of the broker to protect its customers who may also be suffering due to the increase in fuel prices.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Fuel is affecting both sides of the equation,&rdquo; Dobson added.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDepending on the type of business in which a customer is engaged, that business may also be incurring more costs to operate due to fuel increases. For example, one of Trinity&rsquo;s customers is a clam business. This company owns 30 plus ships which all run on diesel fuel which is now costing more to operate, thus decreasing their profit margins. This company must rely on its brokers to keep those margins from decreasing further.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;They negotiate with Trinity to get a better deal on their end,&rdquo; Dobson said.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tEvery transaction (load) is negotiated with the carriers, according to Dobson. No standard rates are offered to carriers due to the fluctuations in the marketplace which obviously include fuel.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe change in the economy has also led to changes in the trucking business. The supply of trucks is currently greater than the number of goods being produced that need to be shipped. Dobson said that, as a result, many trucking companies are selling parts of their fleets to foreign businesses.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Overseas companies are attracted because their currency is strong against the dollar,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDobson said that Trinity&rsquo;s business has managed to remain steady despite these obstacles, but it has not seen the geometric growth of late that it has experienced in the past.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had to tighten up and look for new ways to do business,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDobson said that some carriers are attempting to bypass the broker and go directly to the customer to arrange shipment in order to allegedly cut costs. Dobson said that cutting out the broker can actually cost the customer more money in the long run if the carrier he uses is not reliable.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBefore Trinity matches a customer with a carrier, its Carrier Compliance Department has thoroughly investigated the carrier using its Motor Carrier Authority number.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Trinity only deals with carriers who have a Motor Carrier Authority Number (aka an MC Number),&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDobson said. &ldquo;That way we can ensure that our customer is dealing with a legitimate, solid trucker who we have a way of checking out thoroughly.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDobson feels that Trinity adds value that saves the customer time and money.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTrinity&rsquo;s customer sales department does not simply take the freight order and pass it on to the carrier. Representatives also make appointments for the customer and determine if the customer&rsquo;s and carrier&rsquo;s delivery terms are feasible. Dobson said that going through a broker can also save customers money by not having to staff its own traffic department with people to do the things Trinity does for them.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"325","cat_name":"Trinity Foundation","title":"5th Annual Trinity Foundation Golf Tournament","url_title":"5th-annual-trinity-foundation-golf-tournament","entry_date":"1215462180","exerpt":"The 5th Annual Trinity Foundation Golf Tournament will be held September 6th at Heritage Shores Golf Club in Bridgeville, DE.

A surety bond ensures the financial responsibility of brokers by providing for payments to shippers or motor carriers if the broker fails to carry out its contracts, agreements, or arrangements for the supplying of transportation by authorized motor carriers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTrinity Transport, Inc. is licensed by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) as a broker arranging the movement of materials by motor carrier. In this capacity, Trinity is currently required to meet certain qualifications to conduct business, which includes the compliance of a $10,000 surety bond. &ldquo;In support of the Transportation Intermediaries Association (TIA) and other transportation lobbyists, &ldquo;said Robert Farrell, VP of Corporate Risk, &ldquo;Trinity has chosen to proactively get in front of the bill before Congress and do so in a voluntary way through the TIA. Eventually, all brokers will be required to increase their respective surety bonds.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The legal issues that go into defending brokers are centered on claims and negligence. Some carriers have $50,000 some have $100,000 in cargo insurance. If we put a carrier on a load and the insurance is not sufficient our contingent policy kicks in. However, the consignee can come back on Trinity for the &lsquo;full value&rsquo; of the load. Trinity also has Errors and Risk Insurance for negligence issues. &ldquo; said Robert Farrell, &rdquo;In order to do business today brokers need to make sure their surety is sufficient in case a carrier or consignee files or co-files on our bond.&rdquo; Trinity constantly looks for areas to provide greater value for its customers.

Kotter, and I loved it.&nbsp; Professor Kotter very clearly defines the 3 stages of urgency and explains the importance of a true sense of urgency.&nbsp; I thought I would share his key points in the hopes that you are sparked to put these ideas into place within your own organization.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The first stage of urgency Professor Kotter explains is one of complacency<\/strong>, defined as &ldquo;a feeling of contentment or self satisfaction, especially when coupled with an unawareness of danger or trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; When a person, department, or company is in a state of complacency, the general feeling is complete contentedness with the status quo.&nbsp; People tend to think: &ldquo;I know what to do and I do it. If there is a problem, it&rsquo;s not mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their behavior is unchanging, opportunities and hazards are equally ignored, and their focus is purely internal.&nbsp; The consequences? The world around you moves on while you stay the same.&nbsp; Competitors will change and innovate to meet your customer&rsquo;s demands, because for the complacent, change either doesn&rsquo;t happen fast enough or it doesn&rsquo;t happen at all.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The second stage of urgency is a false sense of urgency.&nbsp; <\/strong>This is flurry of energy and activity built out of failures.&nbsp; Often, the failures are the result of complacency, leading management to put intense pressure on their team to perform exceedingly well and unrealistically fast.&nbsp; Someone in this stage is frantic, stressed, anxious, frustrated, and exhausted.&nbsp; There is very high activity with very low productivity.&nbsp; For these people, the problems still lie somewhere else, but now they will experience very defensive reactions.&nbsp; They will hold fast to what is being done right and will partake in finger-pointing attacks on others.&nbsp; The consequences of this are equally destructive to complacency.&nbsp; The unproductive activity and pressure is fueled by a team full of anxiety and anger.&nbsp; There are many wasted hours and lost opportunities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The ideal stage is a true sense of urgency.<\/strong>&nbsp; This is driven by a belief that &ldquo;the world contains great opportunities and hazards&rdquo; and &ldquo;a gut-level determination to move, and win, now!&rdquo;&nbsp; There are four tactics laid out in the book that you can use to obtain a true sense of urgency in your organization, but I&rsquo;m just going to touch on the one that I think is the easiest to implement right now. We hear it all the time &ndash; your attitudes, feelings, and actions are contagious.&nbsp; The one thing you can do that will start a ripple effect of urgency is to behave with urgency every day.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to have a true sense of urgency and not slip into complacency, it&rsquo;s important to remember that past successes tell us nothing about the future.&nbsp; Often, sports imitate life, and you don&rsquo;t have to look too far to see prior success not resulting in success the following year&hellip; just look at the Super Bowl winners from 2008-2012.<\/p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"width: 500px;\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Year Won<\/th>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Team<\/th>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">Following Year&#39;s Result<\/th>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t<\/thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2012<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Giants<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Missed playoffs<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2011<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Packers<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Lost opening round playoffs<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2010<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Saints<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Lost opening round playoffs<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2009<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Steelers<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Missed playoffs<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2008<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Giants<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Lost opening round playoffs<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n\n<p>Two didn&rsquo;t qualify for the playoffs at all, and the three that did had a combined 0-3 record.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure that complacency and the thought of &ldquo;we did it this way last year, it&rsquo;ll work again this year!&rdquo; contributed to why these teams saw the results they did. Winning today does not guarantee success tomorrow.&nbsp; We all have to work at it; we have to be better today than yesterday.&nbsp; Every day is an opportunity for you to win,&nbsp; so we must choose to do so and then make sure victory happens.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>So where is your sense of urgency?&nbsp; Where is your department or your company?&nbsp; Where are your competitors, your customers, your stakeholders?&nbsp; We hope you will notice a difference when you call Trinity.

Additionally, Trinity had to achieve a thorough understanding of what Patterson Pump&rsquo;s true needs were.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tTo gain deeper knowledge of our customers, we must ask questions. Through the entrenchment model, we asked a lot of questions to a lot of people in a lot of different departments. Of course, each department has their own specific needs. For example, the accounting manager needs a consolidated statement with correct reference numbers. They are less concerned about which carrier is used. Whereas, the purchasing manager needs to have their shipments received on-time every time to meet production schedules, the shipping\/receiving manager needs pick-ups to be made on- time in order to meet on-time delivery percentages... The IT director needs our technology and their technology to be compatible&hellip; and the CFO&rsquo;s needs are to manage costs.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThrough entrenchment you become the person that can connect the dots in their organization. You know what must occur to get to the next place. You become a very valuable partner.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tChoosing Trinity Logistics to become your one-stop-shop is a long term commitment, and it&rsquo;s one that evolves over time through trust and partnership. It is an ongoing process that requires communication and, at times, reevaluation of your company&rsquo;s needs.

Coming from your fellow peer, me, I know what you are going through. So here are some observations and suggestions I have noticed about college recruitment, and what to look for when searching for your career.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLately, in the college scene, the big sell for job recruiting has been &ldquo;Company Culture.&rdquo; I used to think that when looking for a job, you should look at the pay, industry, location, and schedule, but businesses have turned their approach around in emphasizing the atmosphere, the people you work with, and the company attitude. I&rsquo;ve realized that there is much more to my job than my title, desk, and tasks; it&rsquo;s how I feel when I wake up and go to work, how I feel when I step through the doors, and how I feel at 5:00pm.<br \/>\n\tEveryone wants to be happy at their workplace, right? So why not research, visit, or intern at the places you&rsquo;re interested in working for? Here are some tips I would give when deciding the company culture you want to live in.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}teddy.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 350px; float: left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;\" \/>ATMOSPHERE:<\/strong> Depending on what atmosphere you&rsquo;re most confortable in, check out the office! Do they have a cafeteria? Do they have a gym? Will you be stuck in a cubicle alone all day? Is there free coffee? These may sound like they have nothing to do with choosing a job, but the perks really do matter! I love that every day at Trinity, there are always drinks and healthy snacks at my disposal. If I don&rsquo;t have time to make it to the gym where I live, why not fit in a little work out on my lunch break? I will never forget the first day I walked in here, because the company founder, Ed Banning, brings his adorable dog, Teddy, to work every day. Teddy walks around the office and gives friendly hello&rsquo;s to the team members. Being a dog lover myself, I thought this was so cool!<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>THE PEOPLE:<\/strong> Oh my gosh, the people! You are going to spend more time with these people than your family and friends, so definitely meet the people. Are they friendly? Do they make you feel welcome and confortable? Are they the same age as you? Is there diversity?&nbsp; At Trinity, after I felt comfortable with the atmosphere, meeting the people was the icing on the cake. Humor is huge here. Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, we get our work done, but why not have fun doing it? Take a little break to stretch your legs and get to know your fellow team members. There are also so many team building meetings. For my first one, we had to toss plastic balls like we were hiking a football, and my team got the most balls in the target! So I walked away with a gift card.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>ATTITUDE: <\/strong>Being a young professional myself, I can tell you that I was certainly not thrilled to think about being a working adult. But then reality set in, and I had to make the most of my experience. So first and foremost, don&rsquo;t be negative! Finding out what you&rsquo;re passionate about and good at is important to your job. Waking up knowing you don&rsquo;t have a mean supervisor that&rsquo;s just going to upset you all day or make you feel uncomfortable really makes a difference. Leave work feeling happy with what you did that day, and excited to start tomorrow.&nbsp; When you love your job, you don&rsquo;t work a day in your life.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo what I am trying to get at is don&rsquo;t settle! Look beyond the scope of the job description. Do your extra credit homework when applying to places you want to work for. There is more to the day than just doing WORK.

Of course, we see some slight changes with accessorial charges, but largely our contract pricing keeps the industry fluctuation manageable for our client base.&nbsp; For clients with adequate volume, we&rsquo;ve also seen significant advantages in working to secure specific LTL pricing for their own company instead of using Trinity&rsquo;s blanket rates.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tExamples of recent LTL rate increases:<\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"width: 600px;\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\n\t\t\t\tLTL Carrier<\/th>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\n\t\t\t\tIncrease Announced<\/th>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">\n\t\t\t\tEffective Date<\/th>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t<\/thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tDependable Highway Express<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t5.90%<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tApril 22, 2013<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tABF Freight System<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t5.90%<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tMay 28, 2013<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tYRC Freight<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t5.90%<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tJune 3, 2013<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tHolland<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t5.90%<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tJune 3, 2013<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tReddaway<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t5.90%<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tJune 3, 2013<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tNew Penn Motor<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t5.90%<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tJune 3, 2013<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tUPS Freight<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t5.90%<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tJune 10, 2013<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tCon-way Freight<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t5.90%<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tJune 24, 2013<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tFedEx<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\t4.50%<\/td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t\tJuly 1, 2013<\/td>\n\t\t<\/tr>\n\t<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>\n\tOther changes in pricing for LTL shipments are expected as a result of the recent decisions following a meeting of the Commodity Classification Standards Board (CCSB).

The rule states that you must take a 34-hour restart for every 168 hours worked.

You will be allowed a period of 14 consecutive hours of duty time after being off duty for 10 or more consecutive hours, and this 14 hours starts as soon as you begin any kind of work. After 14 hours, you must then be off duty again for at least 10 consecutive hours. Within the 14 consecutive on duty hours you are allotted 11 hours to drive. Once you have driven a total of 11 hours, you must take your 10 consecutive hours of off duty time. You must also take a 30 minute off-duty or sleeper-berth period if it has been 8 hours since your last break of at least 30 minutes.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are many references that are linked in this article, and we urge you to not skip over them, please read them and make yourselves aware of what&rsquo;s coming.

","content":"<p>\n\tIf you have been around the transportation industry for any length of time, you have likely seen a lot of change. It&rsquo;s intriguing to look back at the history of intermodal logistics and how the process has evolved. We&#39;ll examine three aspects in particular &ndash; ramp operations, equipment, and technology.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tRamp Operations<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tBack in the &lsquo;60&rsquo;s and &lsquo;70&rsquo;s, if you were around, you&rsquo;ll remember the &ldquo;circus style&rdquo; ramps.&nbsp; Flat cars butted up to these ramps, allowing &ldquo;hostler drivers&rdquo; to drive onto the flat cars and pull the inbound trailers from the flat cars.&nbsp; Of course, each stanchion had to be knocked down for each trailer so the truck could hook up and pull them down the ramp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tMoving forward to the <a href=\"\/freight-services\/intermodal\">intermodal shipping <\/a>of today, the ramps now have straddle cranes, as well as side loaders that allow the operator to lift a trailer or container from the flat car.&nbsp; A benefit of using these cranes is the speed of getting units on and off the rail cars.&nbsp; One of the many goals that intermodal logistics providers have been trying to achieve for years is to make intermodal more competitive with over-the-road shipping in regards to transit time, so by speeding up operations at the ramps, rail shipments can be made available to customers quicker than in years past.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tEquipment<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tStepping back again into the &lsquo;60&rsquo;s and &lsquo;70&rsquo;s, the railroads moved trailers on flat cars with hitches.&nbsp; Each flat car could carry two 45 foot trailers, so on a 6,000 foot train, the ramp could load up approximately 100 &ndash; 120 trailers.&nbsp; The &ldquo;ride&rdquo; for the intermodal units was somewhat rough back then, due to the &ldquo;slack&rdquo; action of the drawbars between each flat car.&nbsp; The drawbars had a cushioning device that acted like a huge shock absorber, but the &ldquo;slack&rdquo; action of the train could cause the loads to shift.&nbsp; The trailer size also went through many changes - the 45 foot trailers soon became 48 foot trailers and then 53 foot trailers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFast forwarding to 2013, the rail industry has improved the carrying capacity of an intermodal train by moving containers in lieu of trailers. The containers allow the opportunity to stack one container on top of another, thus moving twice as many loads on a train as you could when moving trailers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThis transition meant many things had to change. The cranes at the intermodal ramps had to be equipped so they could top-lift the container, versus the bottom-lift that was used on the trailers. The flat cars had to be redesigned so the container on the bottom would sit closer to the rail, and this had to be done so the ultimate height of the two containers would be low enough so they could clear bridges. Another benefit of lowering the flat car closer to the rail was to lower the center of gravity for the two containers, thus providing a more stable ride. The container went through changes just as the trailer did &ndash; first, the 48 foot container was thought to be the final replacement for trailers, but the 53 foot container came along and is now the primary domestic box for moving freight intermodally.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tTechnology<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tLet&rsquo;s take one more trip back to the &lsquo;60&rsquo;s and &lsquo;70&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The technology used during this time period was limited, to say the least. Pencil and paper were used to check loads in and out of the ramps.&nbsp; The records for the truck companies and drivers that moved the boxes were also primarily kept with pencil and paper.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen a rail shipment entered the system, quoting a current intermodal shipping customer, the load went into a &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t a good way to trace the shipments across the country.&nbsp; The customers had no idea when their shipments would arrive, and it was very difficult for the draymen to plan their daily schedules because they didn&rsquo;t have any idea what was coming. They would generally find out when the load arrived that it was then available for delivery.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, moving forward to 2013, there are very few pencils and paper used today.&nbsp; In fact, most ramps use electronic handheld devices that are connected to a mainframe computer that allows the ramp operator to check containers in and out. Tracking and tracing has also improved &ndash; companies are now provided with literal minute-by-minute updates on where their shipments are, and they also receive estimated times of arrival of the trains to their destination. This also allows the ramp operators to assign parking lot locations to each container.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThese three factors are just a small sampling of the many changes that have occurred in the intermodal logistics segment of the transportation Industry.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s impossible not to wonder &ndash; what&rsquo;s next? Will the technology continue to change? Will the container sizes change again? Will the ramp operations change so that intermodal can become more and more like an OTR move in both quality of ride and transit time? Only time will tell.<br \/>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"355","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Transportation Management Software: The Missing Piece to Your Puzzle","url_title":"a-tms-could-be-the-missing-piece-to-your-puzzle","entry_date":"1376056740","exerpt":"Have you heard the saying \u201cthere\u2019s always room for improvement?\u201d  That\u2019s exactly right when you\u2019re looking for a solution to better your supply chain processes.

You don&rsquo;t have to be a Fortune 500 company to streamline freight spend, enhance reporting, and create efficiencies. We even offer a tiered pricing system with varying levels of features to make it easy for you to select a TMS option that fits your budget.<\/p>\n\n<h3><em>Myth #2:<\/em> A TMS will replace my job<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>Fact: <\/strong>This one always makes us shake our heads in wonder.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re going to look like a hero for taking the initiative to present an opportunity for your company to grow and improve! The savings you will be able to demonstrate from your newly-created efficiencies alone will be enough to &ldquo;wow&rdquo; your supervisors. Even better? You can be the one at the helm, managing implementation, training your teams, and monitoring and supervising the entire supply chain, making you a more valuable piece of the puzzle &ndash; not less.<\/p>\n\n<h3><em>Myth #3: <\/em>A TMS is too difficult and time consuming to use<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>Fact:<\/strong> If the TMS you&rsquo;re considering appears difficult to use, you&rsquo;re looking at the wrong TMS. The system you select should be user-friendly and intuitive, easy to navigate, and simple to explain. When we demonstrate our software, we can create a sandbox in which your team can &ldquo;play&rdquo; in with real data in order to show you how a customized portal can not only link your entire team together, but put to rest concerns about the system being too difficult - for even the least technologically-savvy users. If you really want to talk about things that are time-consuming,&nbsp; how much fun is it to juggle a bunch of different spreadsheets and keep track of carrier rates &ldquo;the old-fashioned way&rdquo;?<\/p>\n\n<h3><em>Myth #4:<\/em> I won&rsquo;t be able to get all our locations in sync<\/h3>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\n<p><strong>Fact: <\/strong>Trinity can work with your team every step of the way to help implement the transportation management software across all locations, training every team member and explaining your business operating procedures. Not only will you have support in getting everyone into the system, we can also provide accountability measures to show you when a location isn&rsquo;t playing by your established rules. This will help provide you with hard facts about sunk costs due to improper carrier selection and rogue routing.<\/p>\n\n<h3><em>Myth #5:<\/em> We will lose control\/ownership of our pricing<\/h3>\n\n<p><strong>Fact:<\/strong> If you aren&rsquo;t using our blanket pricing, and come into the freight management relationship with your own carriers and your own pricing, those stay in your name. Trinity works under your authorization to keep those carrier networks and to demonstrate the volume you provide each carrier. Our TMS easily creates reports to show the freight breakdown per provider, and you can leverage that with our logistics consulting services, in which we&rsquo;re able to help you with a managed RFP process each year. You will always own your pricing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, with those five myths busted, the idea of transportation management software sounds a lot more appealing! We offer free <a href=\"\/request-a-consultation\">consultations<\/a> if you&rsquo;re still on the fence. Get in touch with us today, and we&rsquo;ll answer any lingering questions you may have about the implementation of a TMS.<\/p>\n\n<div id=\"slidebox\">\n\t<a class=\"close\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/request-a-consultation?utm_source=SlideInCTA&amp;utm_medium=TMS5MythsBlog&amp;utm_campaign=CTA\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}TMS-slidein.jpg\" style=\"width: 90%; height: auto; border: none;\" \/><\/a><\/div>"}, {"ID":"365","cat_name":"Company Culture","title":"Trinity Logistics Featured on the Inc. 5000 List of Fastest-Growing Private Companies","url_title":"trinity-logistics-featured-on-the-inc.-5000-list-of-fastest-growing-private","entry_date":"1377003600","exerpt":"Inc.

We&rsquo;ve never been one to toot our own horn, so rather than dwelling on these awards, we instead want to take this opportunity to help other companies learn how to improve and transform their own company cultures by implementing the ideas we&rsquo;ve been growing here at our own company.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhether you like it or not, and whether you&rsquo;re aware of it or not, your company has a culture. If you don&rsquo;t spend time and effort shaping it into what&rsquo;s best for your business and your employees, a culture may develop that is undesirable. Sometimes, this happens before you even realize it has occurred. A common example is what we call the &ldquo;complacent culture&rdquo;&hellip; employees in this environment tend to fear change, and they don&rsquo;t feel pushed to innovate. They&rsquo;re not growing and they&rsquo;re content to remain static. They avoid taking responsibility and there&rsquo;s no focus on building relationships. Whether your culture has regressed to this and you&rsquo;re in crisis mode, or you&rsquo;re just looking to improve the positive and growing culture you&rsquo;ve already built, these descriptions of the cornerstones of our own company culture will likely be a great resource for you.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe&rsquo;re going to talk about growth, appreciation, involvement, innovation, servant leadership, and continuous improvement.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tGrowth<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tGrowth is perhaps the most important part of our culture. Of course, it&rsquo;s vital for our company to grow &ndash; but we focus on the personal and professional growth of our team members and their leaders. We have quarterly goal-setting programs that we take seriously, setting action steps and holding accountability meetings to ensure we&rsquo;re meeting our personal and professional goals. We offer tuition assistance for anyone looking to take a class and expand their job-related knowledge. We offer unique leadership classes developed in-house for all company &amp; team leaders and for those who may eventually step into a leadership role. We constantly challenge our team members to be growing every single day.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tAppreciation<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tOur team members consistently feel appreciated and recognized for the hard work they put in every day. We have an MVP program, which involves a huge bulletin board at the front of our office where team members post slips recognizing each other for going above and beyond. Everyone is encouraged to speak up and let others know when someone has done something truly awesome. Our CFO often wanders around the office with a couple of gift cards in his pocket that he&rsquo;s ready to toss out when he&rsquo;s learned that a team member did something remarkable. There are often day-long events and celebratory meals at the office simply meant to recognize and appreciate the hard work that everyone has put in. We&rsquo;ve found that when your employees feel appreciated, they will work even harder and be even more incredible!<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tInvolvement<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tAt some companies, employees may feel incredibly removed from upper management and the inner workings of the business. Basically, they feel like a little ant, practically invisible to the bigger and more important characters around them. That is not the case here. Our leaders are intimately connected with our team members, working together every day. Our CEO knows everyone here by name, and he holds quarterly meetings, open to all, to review company performance and our progress towards our company goals and vision. The fact that everyone who works here is intimately connected and has the ability to make an impact on the entire company really encourages the feeling of involvement and importance that is vital to our culture.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tInnovation<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tOur team members are encouraged to think outside the box and share their ideas without fear of judgment or repercussion. Our &ldquo;Imagine A Bright Idea&rdquo; program ensures all ideas will be heard and followed up on. Team members can submit their ideas, whether it&rsquo;s about how to improve a process or a completely new concept entirely, and the idea is assigned to a relevant company leader to follow up and investigate implementation. As you may notice, these six aspects of our culture all ultimately start weave together&hellip;the new ideas that stem from this innovation encourage continuous improvement, the dedication of our leaders is a great example of involvement and servant leadership, and the guaranteed feedback about new ideas is another form of recognition.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tServant Leadership<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tAt many companies, team members work for their leader, in a traditional pyramid model with the &ldquo;workers&rdquo; at the base and the chain of command headed to the tip of the pyramid. At our company, we&rsquo;ve inverted that traditional model to embrace a servant mentality. Our leaders are the base, serving their team members. Our &ldquo;upside-down triangle&rdquo; model of servant leadership has been a major component of our culture because it&rsquo;s ultimately enabled all the other aspects to come to fruition. Our leaders&rsquo; ultimate goal has always been to remove obstacles for their team. This factor allows our team members to truly feel the empowerment required to take this culture and run with it. With their leaders available as a resource for coaching, accountability, and assistance, anything is possible.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tContinuous Improvement<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tWe have never been content with the average or the ordinary. Our team members are always striving to improve their productivity, their customer service, their daily processes, their interactions with others, and their overall impact. With the empowered culture to back them, this doesn&rsquo;t feel intimidating or overwhelming &ndash; it feels exhilarating and meaningful. We&rsquo;re constantly brainstorming about ways to save money, ways to automate tasks without losing the human touch, ways to improve our office relationships, and ways to improve processes that don&rsquo;t even have anything to do with us! This is what allows our culture to keep growing and growing.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you have any questions about our culture or would like to discuss it further, we love the opportunity to help others!

This transportation bill marks a huge milestone in the history of our country&rsquo;s government, but if you&rsquo;re a manufacturer or distributor, it could also mean some changes for you &amp; the way you do business. We know &ndash; legislation tends to be freakishly difficult to understand, and when it comes to how it&rsquo;ll actually affect you, comprehension enters the realm of impossibility&hellip; but we&rsquo;re here to help! Let&rsquo;s break down the pieces of this new legislation and get right down to how you could be impacted.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFirst, some quick background information: President Obama signed this bill into law on July 6th of last year. The bill was enacted (officially made law) on October 1st of last year, and the requirements go into effect on October 1st of this year, one year later. Basically, there&rsquo;s 29 new rules that the FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) will be implementing. Some of these have to do with cars, roads, bridges, and other various transportation issues that don&rsquo;t directly affect the shipper, but a chunk of them do.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe most important things you should be aware of:<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Within 2 years, all commercial vehicles will be required to be equipped with EOBRs (event-on-board-recorders). <\/strong>The goal here is to track hours of service and ensure that all carriers are compliant. Drivers certainly can&rsquo;t fudge their log-books if the log-book is replaced with an electronic device that records whenever the truck is in motion, right? That&rsquo;s the idea. While this will definitely help enforce the HOS regulations, word on the street is that this new requirement could put thousands of motor carriers out of business &ndash; especially the mom &amp; pop, owner-operator folks. Currently, EOBRs are somewhat prohibitively expensive, and if you can&rsquo;t afford the equipment, you can&rsquo;t legally be on the road. If you tend to rely on small carriers, there&rsquo;s a chance your favorite folks to work with may not be able to comply with this new law.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>All freight brokers must hold a surety bond of at least $75,000.<\/strong> This is a huge increase from the previous requirement of $10,000. This bond is essentially an easy way for a broker to communicate to you, &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve invested this money in my business &ndash; I&rsquo;m not some shady guy operating out of my garage who will double- or triple- broker your freight.&rdquo; This aspect of the bill was arguably the most controversial, and the original legislation actually proposed an increase to a $100,000 bond &ndash; but opposition resulted in the slight decrease. Many small brokers are concerned that being unable to afford the higher surety bond will put them out of business. While the increase means you&rsquo;re less likely to inadvertently deal with a shady broker, it also will shrink the pool of brokers for you to choose from. (If you work with Trinity, not to worry &ndash; we&rsquo;ve had a $250,000 bond for years now, which is the highest possible.)<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Being a truck driver and running a trucking company, in general, is going to become way more complicated. <\/strong>Within a year, new standards for minimum truck driver training will be announced. There will also be a national driver registry, connecting CDL information with other important safety information &ndash; like drug &amp; alcohol testing, plus compliance and driving records. Carrier registration will be changing, due to the implementation of a unified registration system for all carriers, brokers, and freight forwarders. Laws are becoming more stringent, restricting the &ldquo;revival&rdquo; of MC numbers whose authority has previously been revoked, and requiring carriers to publicly declare their relationship with other trucking companies they own or are owned by. In general, these stricter regulations will be good for you, ensuring the carriers you&rsquo;re working with are being completely up-front about their authority and affiliations, and ensuring that the drivers on the road are properly trained.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOverall, if you work with smaller providers who work locally, rather than on a national scale, you may see some of them start to vanish over the next couple of years &ndash; thanks to MAP-21. Besides that, you can expect to see a general improvement in carrier compliance&hellip; although it may come in exchange for tighter capacity. As always, if you have any further questions about how this new legislation could impact you, <a href=\"\/ask-a-question\">we&rsquo;re here as a resource<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tChime in with a comment below &ndash; what are your thoughts on MAP-21?<\/p>"}, {"ID":"379","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Five Tips for Heavy Haul & Over-Dimensional Shipping","url_title":"five-tips-for-heavy-haul-over-dimensional-shipping","entry_date":"1380049560","exerpt":"The shipment of over-dimensional and\/or heavy haul freight requires a special expertise!

The more notice you can provide of an upcoming OD\/heavy haul shipment, the better.&nbsp; These loads often require specialized equipment that can be in limited supply.&nbsp; By notifying your carrier or logistics provider well in advance, they can get to work on getting the right equipment in position.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Information is king<\/strong>. Knowing the exact information regarding your OD\/heavy haul shipments is extremely important, especially in regards to permits.&nbsp; You should know the length, width, height, and weight of the shipment.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll also need to provide the make, model, and serial number if applicable.&nbsp; Providing accurate information will assist in the permitting process!<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The states become your partners.<\/strong> The issuance of permits for OD\/heavy haul shipments is handled by each individual state.&nbsp; Some handle these requests promptly, while others are slower.&nbsp; As a general rule, the bigger the shipment, the longer it will take.&nbsp; The state will also decide which routes the truck must follow, as well as determine if there are any travel restrictions in terms of hours or days.&nbsp; Often times, weekend and nighttime travel is restricted.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\t<strong>Timing is everything<\/strong>. If your load will need riggers or other specialized equipment to load or unload, this will need to be coordinated up-front.&nbsp; The specialized equipment often used for shipping OD\/heavy haul loads is expensive and in demand.&nbsp; If there are any delays in getting the trucks loaded or unloaded, there will be detention charges that can be significant.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Tarp troubles<\/strong>. Please know if your load will require tarping!&nbsp; OD loads will often require more tarps than the typical truck carries.&nbsp; If your shipping partner is aware of this upfront, they can be sure the truck will have the necessary tarps.&nbsp; Large and\/or odd-sized pieces will be difficult for even the best drivers to tarp by themselves.&nbsp; Any assistance you can offer is appreciated, even if it&rsquo;s simply a safe place out of the elements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBeing aware of these elements of over-dimensional and heavy haul freight can help ensure your freight arrives at its destination in a safe and timely manner, and Trinity stands ready to help with all your shipments!

Their skills literally change the game as you know it and make the impossible seem reachable. What&rsquo;s so different about a game changer that sets them apart? What makes them so special that you have to do everything you can to recruit them to participate in your project, vision, or company? We&rsquo;ve learned that there are 5 key characteristics of a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo;. With game changers on your team, you&rsquo;re empowered to accomplish goals you&rsquo;ve only dreamed of before.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A game changer has a passionate belief in the vision.&nbsp;<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">They can paint a picture of what they believe success will look like in the future. To hear them talk about it, their enthusiasm is almost tangible. Most importantly, they describe the goals and steps they&rsquo;re putting into place in order to meet that vision and make it a reality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>They&rsquo;re unafraid to go up against any competition.&nbsp;<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">You&rsquo;ll often find them welcoming discussions about whomever they&rsquo;re up against, not because a game changer is arrogant, but because they&rsquo;re confident. They believe in their company, product, service, or cause and can rationalize intelligently how they&rsquo;re the clear choice and clear winner every time. Bring on the objections and comparisons, because they&rsquo;re in competition with themselves only, trying to outdo their last top performance and improve again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>They employ any and all tactics to change strategy and influence momentum.&nbsp;<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">Obstacles are taken in stride. A game changer isn&rsquo;t rattled when the chips are down; they&rsquo;ll rally and return every time. These are the people you can go to in a pinch and they&rsquo;ll always have a clever approach to offer. Ego and pride get checked at the door, they&rsquo;re quick to admit mistakes or the need to adjust tactics and quickly implement the new direction to get the ball rolling again in the right direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>They have a steadfast drive and determination to win.&nbsp;<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">It&rsquo;s the classic image of a bulldog with a juicy bone - a game changer can taste success and will not let you shake it from them. Remember, they&rsquo;ve already bought in to the vision, and they&rsquo;re going to do anything required to achieve that win. They&rsquo;re able to refuel their own batteries, keep their own fires lit, and recover much easier from setbacks because they&rsquo;re dedicated to win and outperform your expectations of them. They&rsquo;re not happy until you&rsquo;re happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>They have a take-charge approach.&nbsp;<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">Put a game changer in a room with others and assign a task. Watch them emerge as the natural leader of the group every time. Game changers are no-nonsense and begin with the end in mind. They gather all the facts, can identify what needs to be done, and quickly discern the best methods to arrive there. What&rsquo;s more, they&rsquo;re able to gather the other team members to rally to support the goal as well!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\n\tTake a moment to evaluate not only your direct team or department in your organization, but your suppliers.

Figuring out exactly what you&rsquo;re entitled to from the carrier can be tricky, but we have extensive knowledge of these processes and can provide you with the resources you need when you&#39;re dealing with a claim.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDid you know that when you ship LTL, the type of quote you get and your product&rsquo;s freight class will determine the amount of monetary reimbursement on your damaged or lost cargo? Every LTL carrier has a published, customized set of tariffs that state their maximum liability in the event of cargo loss or damage. These tariffs also state what accessorial and special charges the carrier will and will not be responsible for and the amount you will be charged for each particular service in the event they occur (such as liftgate, white glove, or redelivery).<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAt the time of &ldquo;booking&rdquo; or &ldquo;quoting&rdquo;, the carrier will class the items being shipped in accordance with their NMFC number. The class the items are shipped under will determine the freight rate and your return on loss or damage. There are also certain types of quotes that can initially dictate the carrier&rsquo;s maximum liability in the event of loss or damage: volume, spot and truckload quotes. In the event you are quoted by one of these methods, your return for loss or damage will be covered at $1.00 per pound, regardless of the stated maximum liability for that class.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\tRemember, after a formal claim has been filed and before any claim funds are paid out by the carrier, they will perform an investigation to establish liability for the loss or damage. If you are a party in charge of packaging or shipping merchandise, you are responsible for making sure the product is labeled correctly and packaged in accordance with the NMFC packaging requirements for that particular item. Otherwise, the carrier may rightfully decline your claim due to insufficient packaging.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are a party involved in shipping or brokering LTL freight, it is a very good idea to familiarize yourself with the tariffs of each of the LTL carriers you will be utilizing, as all of them carry different amounts of liability and vary in the amounts they charge for their accessorial or special services. All LTL carriers&rsquo; tariffs are public information that is available on their websites or upon request.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs always, if you have any questions regarding limitations of liability, claims, or what to do in the case of OSD&rsquo;s (overages, shortages and damages) feel free to contact the claims department <a href=\"mailto:claims@trinitylogistics.com?subject=Question%20about%20your%20LTL%20claims%20blog\">via email<\/a> or give us a call at 1-800-846-3400 x. 2146!<\/p>\n<div id=\"slidebox\">\n\t<a class=\"close\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/trinity-topics-june14?utm_source=SlideInCTA&amp;utm_medium=LTLClaimsWhatYouShouldKnowBlog&amp;utm_campaign=CTA\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}LTLtopics-slidein.jpg\" style=\"width: 90%; height: auto; border: none;\" \/><\/a><\/div>"}, {"ID":"388","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It...

I laughed at the warehouse full of beepers going off every three seconds (I&rsquo;d have gone crazy after the first few minutes), questioned the sanity of the woman who married a warehouse (but, hey, who am I to judge?) and cringed at the warehouse manager who stuck his finger in a barrel of poisonous chemicals.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSome of the stories on the blog, however, were not so far-fetched, and this got me to thinking about less obvious signs that your warehouse situation might be broken. Below, I&rsquo;ve outlined a few indicators that it might be time to revisit your current warehousing situation.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tIndicator 1: Trailer Detention Fees<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tTrailer detention fees could be an indicator of a poor warehouse layout (maybe the dock is located too far from the staging area), insufficient manpower (not enough people to load the trucks or stage the product), or simply poor communication between the warehouse and the carrier (maybe the dock can&rsquo;t keep up with their scheduled appointments).<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tIndicator 2: Claims from Shortages or Damages (B2B)<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tClaims could be an indicator that the warehouse has poor receiving processes (maybe problem product is not handled right away and damages are making it back out the door) or poor inventory management (maybe product is getting lost or misplaced and shipments are being shorted).<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tIndicator 3: Refused or Returned Product (B2C)<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tReturns are another indicator that the warehouse could have poor receiving practices or poor inventory management (maybe product is getting mislabeled and put away incorrectly, resulting in the wrong product being shipped).<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tIndicator 4: Large Inventory Discrepancies<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tLarge inventory discrepancies are yet another indicator of poor shipping and receiving practices (maybe the product did not get cycled in and out correctly) or poor inventory management (maybe the warehouse lacks the technology to keep accurate counts of product).<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tIndicator 5: Excessive Transportation Costs<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tExcessive transportation costs could be another indicator of poor receiving practices (maybe you are having to send in extra trucks to replace lost or misplaced product), or it could just be an indicator that your warehouse is not ideally situated between your suppliers and your customers.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tIndicator 6: Carrier Complaints<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tCarrier complaints could be an indicator of poor warehouse layout (maybe the warehouse doesn&rsquo;t have enough docks for the trucks they&rsquo;ve scheduled), insufficient manpower (not enough people to load the trucks or stage the product), or if you find a lot of carriers don&rsquo;t like to deal with that warehouse, it could indicate disrespectful personnel on the dock.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf any of the above apply to you, then it might be a wise decision to re-evaluate your current warehouse partner. But don&rsquo;t worry. You don&rsquo;t have to face this daunting task alone. By partnering with a 3PL, changing warehouses can go from terrifying to manageable. Here are some of the ways a 3PL can make the process more bearable:<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tBenefit 1: Knowledge of Industry Best Practices<\/h3>\n<p>\n\t3PLs make it a point to stay up to speed on industry trends and best practices. By partnering with other experts in the industry, a 3PL will be able to help you find a warehouse to meet your specific needs and requirements.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tBenefit 2: Large Network of Partners<\/h3>\n<p>\n\t3PLs have a large network of partners both domestically and internationally, which means they will easily be able to locate a warehouse in your desired location.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tBenefit 3: Can Arrange Transportation<\/h3>\n<p>\n\t3PLs often have brokerage divisions with a large network of carrier partners. Depending on the consistency of your freight, they can help locate one-off carriers or carriers that will haul the freight on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tBenefit 4: Can Coordinate Manpower (Including Quality Control)<\/h3>\n<p>\n\t3PLs are also experienced in hiring manpower and can help you arrange for quality control officers, security officers, or any other type of labor you may need.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tBenefit 5: Can Audit Warehousing Invoices<\/h3>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\tIf the 3PL arranges the warehousing, then they will be the ones auditing all of the warehouse invoices, ensuring proper billing on pallets in and out, storage fees, clerical fees, etc.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tBenefit 6: Can Optimize Supply Chain<\/h3>\n<p>\n\t3PLs will have the technology and knowledge to look at your current warehouse location as well as the location of your suppliers and customers to advise where the ideal location for your warehouse would be, based on warehousing costs and transportation fees.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhether you need help evaluating your current warehousing or are ready to make the move to a new space, Trinity Logistics can help.

This groundbreaking transportation legislation was a major game-changer and there&rsquo;s still serious buzz about its implications &ndash; especially hot-button issues like required EOBRs on all trucks and the broker bond increase (you can read more about those in our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/the-map-21-act-how-it-could-affect-your-business\">last blog<\/a> on this subject).<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSomething that hasn&rsquo;t received quite as much news coverage but will still have a major impact on the trucking industry is the implementation of what&rsquo;s being called a Unified Registration System, or URS. This particular piece of the bill will begin implementation in just a few days, on November 1st, 2013, with a final compliance date and the system up and running by October 23rd, 2015. So&hellip; what does it mean?<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat is the Unified Registration System (URS)?<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tThis new electronic system will eliminate paper forms in the registration and record keeping process for all carriers, brokers, freight forwarders, and other transportation providers. All of these companies and their authority will now be registered and tracked in the exact same system, all in one place.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tSounds pretty simple! What&rsquo;s the big deal?<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tDue to the implementation of the URS, new information disclosure requirements are being put into place. Because all records will now live in the same unified database, the FMSCA can link records together. Previously, it was requested (but not required) for transportation providers to disclose if they&rsquo;d ever had a different MC number or done business under a different name. Because this wasn&rsquo;t an enforced requirement, sneaky carriers who had terrible CSA scores or had their authority revoked could easily &ldquo;start from scratch&rdquo; and apply for new authority under a new name, with the FMCSA having no real way of tracking their history. These carriers were colloquially known as &ldquo;chameleon carriers&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBecause of the URS, this information is now required to be disclosed. Anyone applying for or renewing their authority must&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">officially declare their past MC numbers or company names so that the records in the unified system can be linked together and no past transgressions fall by the wayside.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>\n\tIs this a good thing?<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tAbsolutely! It&rsquo;s great for us, as a transportation provider who is focused on booking only compliant and reliable carriers for our customers &ndash; and it&rsquo;s great for you, too, if you work with asset-based carriers as well as non-asset based providers like Trinity. There&rsquo;s no such thing as a fresh start for non-compliant carriers anymore. If they&rsquo;ve had their authority revoked, it&rsquo;ll be a blemish on their record forever, and as long as you are properly vetting the carriers you select to move your freight, all of that information will be visible to you. In the past, it was possible to be duped by a &ldquo;chameleon carrier,&rdquo; but the chances of that happening to you now are very slim.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHave questions about the URS or the MAP-21 Act?

In March of this year, over the course of a single month alone, they saved almost $15,000 compared to using the carrier they worked with previously. And if that isn&rsquo;t enough of a sweet treat&hellip; not a single one of those shipments had any damages, a major improvement from their past track record with the other carrier.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnother Trinity customer, a pet food manufacturer, was struggling to find reasonable LTL rates for their regular shipments to one of their customers (about 12-14 pallets per shipment). They were lacking carrier relationships and paying the price &ndash; big time. After consulting with Trinity&#39;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/freight-services\/ltl\">LTL Services<\/a> team for a solution, we were able to assist them in consolidating 2-3 LTL shipments at a time into one truckload shipment and provide them with access to a network of reliable carriers.

You&rsquo;ll only have to work with Trinity during the entire transit of the shipment, instead of having to deal with both Mexican and U.S. carriers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tUnlike highway shipments that must be trans-loaded at the border to a Mexican carrier, with intermodal, the shipments clear and cross the border while staying on the original loaded container &ndash; all the way to the consignee&rsquo;s door, resulting in a lesser chance of damage or shortages due to the trans-loading. The primary border crossing points are Laredo, El Paso and Nogales &ndash; connecting intermodal service between Mexico and most major markets in the United States, moving in both directions.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThere have been many recent articles in major publications about how companies are bringing manufacturing &ldquo;closer to home&rdquo; and establishing plants in Mexico due to lower wages, transportation costs, and shying away from more traditional trading partners like China. A great indication of this is the surge in cross-border intermodal volumes &ndash; in Quarter 2 of 2012, there were 11,461 shipments, compared to Quarter 2 of 2013, with 22,277 shipments &ndash; an increase of 94%!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDue to the large trade imbalance, the biggest cost advantage for you can be found with shipments moving south to Mexico. With all the large manufacturing located in Mexico and the need for equipment there, we can offer very competitive pricing on these shipments.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe railroads have recognized the importance of the expanding Mexican market, and they&rsquo;ve invested large sums in their infrastructure to improve their service. As an example, our largest intermodal rail provider is offering service six days per week between Chicago and Monterrey. Additionally, both Mexican and U.S. customs have taken notice of the large increase in volume, and they&rsquo;ve spent large amounts to modernize and automate the documentation process to avoid any delays at the border.

Watch the short clip below to find out:<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/98BIu9dpwHU\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>\n\tThat&rsquo;s right&hellip; the packages will be delivered by drone. Watching the video is a little bit eerie because it looks and feels like futuristic science fiction, but as they say - the future is now. Amazon hopes to obtain approval to launch this new program as soon as the FAA finalizes the rules and regulations surrounding unmanned aerial vehicles (AKA drones). Amazon claims this should happen sometime in 2015. That&rsquo;s less than two years away.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking of unmanned vehicles, there&rsquo;s another idea buzzing around the trucking industry as of late: robotic trucks. We&rsquo;re talking full-sized tractor-trailers here &ndash; the kind you, reading this right now, probably rely on for your shipments to get from point A to point B. Although this would put many truck drivers out of a job, proponents say it would solve a number of industry issues, particularly the Hours of Service regulations (which would become irrelevant) and truck driver wages (which would no longer be necessary).Like Prime Air, it may seem like a pipe dream, but there are already fully-functional robotic cars on our roadways &ndash; the technology exists.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tA time may come when trucks, trains, planes and ships (and drones&hellip;) aren&rsquo;t the only transportation modes available anymore. Elon Musk (you may know him as the brainchild behind PayPal and Tesla Motors) has been pushing the idea of a transportation method in the United States that he&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;Hyperloop,&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s claimed it will become the &ldquo;fifth transportation mode&rdquo;. This tube system is initially designed with passengers and cars in mind, propelling them at speeds up to 700-some miles per hour, but if it was put in place and became a standard mode of transit, the movement of freight by this method seems like it would inevitably follow. The initial corridor planned for the project runs from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and the trip time would be roughly 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs a logistics &amp; shipping provider, we try to remain on the forefront of industry trends and buzz. If any of these modes actually come to fruition, we can&#39;t wait to offer those services to our customers. What do you think about these ideas and developments?

You&rsquo;re likely accustomed to simply calling up your Account Manager with a shipment and then breathing a sigh of relief, trusting that all the details will be taken care of, from booking to delivery. But have you ever wondered about exactly what process your shipment goes through to make that happen? Today, we&rsquo;ll take you behind the scenes. Your Account Manager actually has a variety of helpers who assist in making sure your shipment smoothly gets from point A to point B. Although the processes vary at each of our offices, this is the typical chain of events at our largest office in Delaware:<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}eric.png\" style=\"width: 160px; height: 160px; float: left;\" \/>Eric <\/strong>is an Account Manager, and he&rsquo;s your single point of contact here at Trinity. Building relationships with his customers and serving all their needs is his main responsibility, as well as ensuring all of his customers&rsquo; shipments are smoothly on their way to their destination with no issues. After you call or email Eric with your truckload shipment information, it moves down the chain, to&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t<strong><img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}vanessa.png\" style=\"width: 160px; height: 160px; float: left;\" \/>Vanessa<\/strong>, who is a Logistics Assistant, and she is Eric&rsquo;s right-hand (wo)man! Vanessa enters all your shipment information into our operating system, and she also schedules&nbsp; the pick-up and delivery later on. She handles the details so that your Account Manager can focus on the big picture and ensure we&rsquo;re constantly exceeding your expectations. Once the shipment has been entered into our system, it&rsquo;s time to find a carrier, so&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}nicole.png\" style=\"width: 160px; height: 160px; float: left;\" \/>The shipment is then assigned to a team of Logistics Specialists, like <strong>Nicole<\/strong>, who are tasked with finding the very best carrier to move the load. There are many factors that go into this decision. The driver&rsquo;s location is taken into consideration, of course &ndash; usually, this means the carrier is dropping off a shipment near the area where your shipment is to be picked up.&nbsp; The carrier must also have the proper equipment to move the load. They also must have the correct insurance required to haul the shipment, as well as fit the requirements for any other customer prerequisites. Yet another factor is Hours of Service &ndash; the driver must have enough hours remaining on their clock to deliver the shipment on schedule. You might imagine that finding a carrier who meets all these requirements could sometimes be a challenge, especially if time is limited &ndash; but our network of 30,000 approved carriers and the fact that our Logistics Specialists are such dedicated relationship builders means that they always have someone to call in a time of need. And thus, your shipment is booked with the ideal carrier!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAfter the carrier has been selected, the Logistics Specialists are also tasked with another extremely important duty &ndash; shipment tracking. If you&rsquo;re a Trinity customer, you&rsquo;ve likely caught on that we are pretty enthusiastic about tracking your shipment obsessively. We have a variety of daily and event-based &ldquo;checkpoints&rdquo; for shipment tracking, and the time of each of the following is logged: when the carrier has finished unloading their current shipment, prior to picking up yours; when they&rsquo;re arriving to pick up your shipment; when they&rsquo;re loaded and leaving; when they&rsquo;re arriving at the delivery location; when the shipment is officially unloaded and delivered; and a general daily check-in.&nbsp; Shew!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe delegation of these responsibilities means our team is a well-greased wheel, working together to ensure a smooth delivery each and every time. Of course, in the transportation industry, and especially with full truckload shipping, sometimes things go wrong. Having such an organized process means we are completely prepared for these unexpected issues. Maybe the truck hauling your load gets a flat tire, or maybe you&rsquo;re not ready to load the shipment when you thought you would be. No matter what happens, the team that&rsquo;s dedicated to your shipment is able to smoothly handle any issues because they are prepared and trained to quickly react and delegate who will solve the problem.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThat&rsquo;s pretty much it! Once the shipment arrives, we let you know, of course, and then the cycle is over &ndash; until you call up your Account Manager with a shipment once more, and it starts over again.

We&rsquo;ve compiled a list of some commonly asked questions about the nuances of shipping LTL.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t<strong>On a basic level, what are some key differences between shipping truckload and shipping LTL?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tA huge difference is transit time. LTL shipments take longer &ndash; it&rsquo;s sort of like taking a bus instead of a taxi. There are multiple stops, rather than one direct trip. The cost of shipping LTL is much cheaper, of course, because the shipments are smaller than a full truckload. There are stricter requirements for the details provided when booking the shipment, as well as how the shipment is packaged. LTL carriers provide a different level of service than truckload carriers, in general&nbsp; - the customer is not able to communicate with the driver, and they have a pre-set schedule that cannot be interrupted. Overall, shipping LTL is just a little less flexible and a little more complicated than shipping truckload.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Why is the insurance coverage different on a spot\/volume LTL shipment vs. a standard LTL shipment? <\/strong><br \/>\n\tLiability is only $1 per pound on spot\/volume LTL shipments because the LTL carriers are giving you a very good price, depending on the capacity available in the lane.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re sacrificing liability coverage and transit time for a great deal. This is something to take into consideration when deciding to go with standard LTL services or ship based on a spot quote, as sometimes you will have both options.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t<strong>What classes\/commodities\/types of shipments do LTL freight companies absolutely LOVE to ship? <\/strong><br \/>\n\tLTL carriers love heavy freight that cannot be easily damaged. This includes bricks, stone, sand, pet food, and other dense commodities. It also depends on the shipper and consignee &ndash; they love being able to deliver dock to dock. Anything that requires extra time for the driver (prisons, schools, churches, residents, ports, grocery warehouses, etc.) will likely result in a higher rate, as the carriers do not want to be held up at all. The more freight they get on and off the truck, the more money they make &ndash; so understandably, they want to go in, get loaded (or unloaded), and get out.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\t<strong>Why is my LTL freight class so high?!&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n\tThere could be a few factors that contribute to this. Does your LTL freight have a high value? Is the commodity light and bulky or easily damageable? Does the packaging make it more vulnerable? All of these aspects can drive up your freight class. The one aspect you have control over is your packaging. Products should be crated or boxed to be protected from other freight on the truck, and it also helps the carrier move your freight around easily when they&rsquo;re at their terminals.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Why don&rsquo;t I get two hours of free time to load and unload my LTL shipments?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tWhile a truckload carrier has to worry about loading and unloading your shipment only, LTL carriers have a lot of freight to pick up and deliver in a day.&nbsp; Wait time costs the LTL carriers both time and money, and pushes back all their other appointments.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s vital for them to stay on schedule.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\t<strong>What does interline mean?<\/strong><br \/>\n\tInterline means that the LTL freight company has a partner carrier that services an area that they do not go into.&nbsp; Instead of the LTL carrier denying service in that area, they hire another carrier to pick up freight or deliver freight to those areas.<br \/>\n\t<br \/>\n\tHopefully some of the things you&rsquo;ve wondered about shipping LTL have been cleared up!

Read on to learn the telltale signs.","content":"<p>We get it &ndash; when you&rsquo;ve been managing your transportation manually, the thought of integrating technology into your processes can be a little intimidating. Especially if you&rsquo;ve been doing things the same way for 15 years. But if you&rsquo;re a good candidate for transportation management software, the time and money you&rsquo;ll save by switching means that it&rsquo;s something you should seriously consider &ndash; and believe it or not, integrating a TMS into your supply chain doesn&rsquo;t mean ditching everything you know.<\/p>\n\n<p>Of course, the pressing question is: how do you know when it&rsquo;s the right time? How can you tell if it&rsquo;s really something you need? Having offered this software solution for years, we&rsquo;ve gradually noticed a pattern. There are two major characteristics that define the companies who truly, desperately need the TMS. To find out if your company fits the mold, read on.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Telltale Sign #1: Too many manual processes<\/h2>\n\n<p>This one is sort of a no-brainer, but if your supply chain is managed in a largely manual fashion, you should consider a TMS. Not sure what we mean? Well, consider your day-to-day tasks. Are you consolidating your loads manually? Do you have a manual quoting and tendering process? Is it impossible for you to report on your transportation data? Are you manually entering data into an Excel spreadsheet? Are you lacking EDI communication? If you have other locations around the country, do you have to call or email them in order to gather shipment information? And perhaps the most telltale sign of all &ndash; are you hand-writing your bills of lading? If this description fits you&hellip; you should seriously consider a TMS.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Telltale Sign #2: Your company is either in growth mode or emergency mode.<\/h2>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\n<p>Most companies peacefully exist somewhere in between these two modes, and if you only fit the bill for the first telltale sign, you should still consider a TMS. However, if your company also falls into one of the two categories below, that means you need to call us and learn more about the TMS literally as soon as you&rsquo;re done reading this blog.<\/p>\n\n<p>What do we mean by <strong>growth mode<\/strong>? We&rsquo;re referencing a specific scenario: your company is experiencing seriously great success, but there is a caveat. Maybe it was unexpected, or maybe you were planning for exponential growth all along, but either way, the success has also brought a drawback: you&rsquo;re drowning. There&rsquo;s so much new business that your old processes aren&rsquo;t efficient enough to work anymore. You&rsquo;re not sure what to do in order to effectively service all your new customers without making some serious changes.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Emergency mode<\/strong> is on the other end of the spectrum. Trouble is on the horizon. Maybe there have been some layoffs, but your team is still expected to handle the same workload. Perhaps the guy who&rsquo;s been handling your transportation is about to retire after 20 years - and no one knows how to do his job. Maybe your company is being acquired, or you&rsquo;re merging with another company, and you&rsquo;re not sure how to integrate or change your supply chain management strategies. Maybe you&rsquo;re facing financial troubles and you need to seriously overhaul who is responsible for what on your staff.<\/p>\n\n<p>No matter which end of the spectrum you fall on, a TMS can address all these issues. The efficiency created by automating your supply chain means you can accomplish more work with less people, freeing up time for your employees to accomplish whatever else is a pressing need.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Okay, I think we might need to consider transportation management software.

Its odd appearance is no coincidence, though. The sleek curves were designed after intense research in order to make the truck 20% more aerodynamic than Walmart&rsquo;s current fleet model. That, combined with the fact that this prototype runs on hybrid technology, means a 10% overall reduction in fuel consumption.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSee how shiny the trailer is? It&rsquo;s made almost completely of a single piece of carbon fiber. This results in a 4,000 pound reduction in overall weight compared to Walmart&rsquo;s current trailers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAn interesting question to ponder: if this truck actually ends up on the road, whether or not Walmart will allow Peterbilt to sell this model (or a variation of it) to anyone who hauls truckload freight. Although it was developed exclusively for Walmart, the positive environmental impact of making this truck available to everyone can&rsquo;t be ignored.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe don&rsquo;t have access to any alien trucks, but we can still help you out with your full truckload shipping needs, if you&rsquo;re okay with your truckload freight showing up in a truck that looks sort of boring in comparison.

Maybe your business has grown from shipping parcel only to shipping one or two pallets at a time and trying to learn about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/freight-services\/ltl\">LTL shipping services<\/a> has your head spinning. Either way, never fear. Shipping LTL can be pretty confusing, but we&#39;re here to help! To start, there are three LTL terms you should be aware of - both their meaning, and their implication. Equipped with this knowledge, you&#39;ll be ready to tackle your first LTL shipment with ease.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>What is my LTL freight class? Why is it so important?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe NMFC (National Motor Freight Classification) guidelines were created, in part, to provide a standardized way for LTL carriers to assess the expense and difficulty involved in transporting a particular commodity. Put simply, your freight class ranks your shipment&#39;s \"transportability\" on a number scale from 50 to 500 - 50 being the easiest to transport, 500 being the most difficult. Items with a low class are usually heavy and dense, like bricks. Items with a higher class are lighter and more fragile, like empty glass containers. Ultimately, class is based on four characteristics: density, stowability, handling, and liability. These factors, combined, all contribute to the freight class.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFreight class is important because it has a huge impact on the cost of LTL shipping. Knowing your freight class is vital to ensure you&#39;re getting an accurate quote on the cost of &nbsp;LTL shipping - and if you ship something listed at the wrong class, your freight would be inspected and your freight charges could increase significantly.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHave no idea what your freight class is? Not to worry. When you provide us with your shipment details, we&#39;ll get all the information we need about the commodity and its packaging to determine your freight class.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>What is an NMFC number? How is an NMFC number different from freight class?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe NMFC has created a system with thousands of numbers that each correspond individually to a single commodity, and they&#39;re very specific. Your NMFC number determines what your freight class is.&nbsp;For example: potato flour is 73080, and listed at class 55, whereas corn flour is 73140, and listed at class 50. Just describing your commodity as \"flour,\" as you can see, is not enough. The NMFC number can change depending on how your commodity is packaged whether it&#39;s in bags, boxes, glass, or crates can have an effect.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAfter your NMFC code has been determined, it&#39;s used to look up the corresponding freight class for your commodity.&nbsp;Again, if you&#39;re not sure of your NMFC number, it&#39;s okay - our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/freight-services\/ltl\">LTL Service<\/a> specialists can take the information you give us about your commodity and its packaging to help you figure out your NMFC number. By doing this we&#39;ll ensure an accurate quote and that you experience no additional freight charges due to classification.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>What does FAK stand for? What does FAK mean in LTL shipping?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\tFAK stands for \"freight all kinds\". If you ship multiple commodities at different freight classes, you can negotiate a FAK in order to ship everything together at the same class. This way, you don&#39;t have to figure out the NMFC number associated with each item you ship. For example, if you ship items at class 70 and other items at class 200, you may want to negotiate a FAK of 100. If you ship a variety of commodities, you should consider contacting us about negotiating a FAK on your behalf. You could see freight savings, the benefit of a standardized freight cost for multiple products and commodities, and protection from <a href=\"\/blog\/ltl-freight-classification-changes-in-2014\">future changes to the classification of your commodities<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe know this is barely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to LTL shipping, but armed with this knowledge, you should feel more confident charging ahead in your new LTL shipping endeavors!

In reality, the culture of any company you decide to do business with will have a huge impact on your experience. Why?<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tHappy employees make happy customers<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tA solid company culture means that employees are happy, fulfilled, and rewarded in their jobs. Naturally, this means better customer service and a better overall experience when communicating with your account manager and whoever else you may have to deal with at the company. If they don&#39;t have anything to grumble about, they&#39;re not going to grumble to you (or about you!) Prioritizing company culture is an easy way to ensure great customer service across the board.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tCustomers and their vendors should have compatible cultures<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tThis is an interesting consideration that many companies don&#39;t ponder. What happens when your vendor&#39;s company culture is very different than your own? It might be okay, as long as the cultures are compatible. But if you prioritize completely different things, it can create issues.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor example: maybe a cornerstone of your company culture is communication. Everyone is on the ball, communicating what&#39;s going on as soon as it happens, and you always know what&#39;s going on with everything, all the time. It makes sense for you to select a vendor (for transportation and otherwise) who values communication in the same way, because if they don&#39;t, it will grind against your natural workflow. For a company who doesn&#39;t stress communication as part of their culture, working with a vendor who isn&#39;t in constant contact but still delivers a great end product would be perfectly fine.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tWhen something goes wrong, true colors come out<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tIn general, relying on an outside company for transportation services or other products should ideally go smoothly with no issues! Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In the crazy world we live in, especially when you&#39;re shipping product, things can and do go wrong sometimes. When that happens, culture is <strong>so<\/strong> important, because it directly impacts how your problem will be handled and resolved (and the manner in which that will be done.)<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIs Trinity&#39;s company culture compatible with your own?

For the purpose of this blog, take a moment to think back to your decision-making process and recall the reasons you decided to go with this lowest rate logistics model. With that in mind, this blog may give you pause to think about the dialogue that could be taking place within your organization in order to determine what your true LTL shipping costs are (this is more than just the rates you&rsquo;re paying). Reconsidering how you view your overall LTL costs vs. individual rates will help you keep your customers happy and allow you to remain one step ahead of your competition.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tCost vs. Rate<\/h3>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Cost <\/strong>refers to the total combined expense of an LTL shipment, including both time and dollars (the shipping, customer service, accounting, administrative tasks, technology, etc.) This includes the rate.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Rate<\/strong> is simply the dollar amount charged by the LTL carrier for the transportation of that same LTL shipment &ndash; meaning the rate is only one part of your overall cost. Rates are easy to identify, whereas identifying cost requires a commitment and collaborative spirit from many levels of an organization, both internally and externally.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tReflect on the first quarter of 2014 and the inclement weather that impacted all of us in the movement of freight. Were you one of the thousands of shippers that experienced missed-pickups, tracking and tracing nightmares, delays, or the communication of incorrect information? Did you lose any customers over it? If so, what was the total cost associated with that? No one can control the weather, but there are certain things that can be controlled, like having a sound LTL program in place.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf the inclement weather taught us anything, it certainly exposed some gaps in many shippers&rsquo; perception that the lowest rate is the most important variable when selecting an LTL shipping provider. More times than not, there is a trade-off between the value you receive and the rate you pay.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\tOne of Trinity&rsquo;s guiding principles is continuous improvement, constantly aspiring to reach our greatest potential. In order to do so, we responded to the inclement weather experience as an opportunity to improve. We evaluated what went right, and what didn&rsquo;t. We discussed it internally, and we discussed it with LTL carriers in our program, and most importantly, we discussed it with our customers.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we found was a common theme across the board. When rate was the sole driving factor in selecting carrier providers as per our customer&rsquo;s requirements, it had much more of a negative impact on the LTL shipping experience through this period than when choosing carrier providers based on overall value.&nbsp; Whether it was delayed transit times or just plain poor customer service, several of our &ldquo;lowest rate&rdquo; customers changed their preferences in the future to avoid this model.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn retrospect, a lot of the pain our LTL customers felt during the first quarter could have been reduced or eliminated by proactively identifying value over rate. There is a place for the lowest rate model, as in some cases it is a good fit (such as when arranging warehouse transfers or returns), but we cannot ignore the fact that in the majority of times, your company&rsquo;s vision and your customer&rsquo;s requirements might not benefit from this method of thinking.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs you review your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/freight-services\/ltl\">LTL logistics<\/a> program, Trinity can work with you through honest dialogue in order to develop a sound recommendation that is flexible yet strong enough to weather the storms of an ever-changing <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/freight-services\/ltl\">LTL service<\/a> industry.<\/p>\n<div id=\"slidebox\">\n\t<a class=\"close\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/trinity-topics-june14?utm_source=SlideInCTA&amp;utm_medium=LTLRateVs.CostBlog&amp;utm_campaign=CTA\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}LTLtopics-slidein.jpg\" style=\"width: 90%; height: auto; border: none;\" \/><\/a><\/div>"}, {"ID":"437","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Truckload Capacity in 2014: A Grim Reality","url_title":"truckload-capacity-in-2014-a-grim-reality","entry_date":"1400161140","exerpt":"The first quarter of 2014 may be behind us, but its effects have certainly not been forgotten.

Although we&rsquo;re now midway through the second quarter, companies (manufacturers and trucking alike) are still scrambling to recover from the unprecedented winter weather and trucking capacity crunch that has had such a hugely negative impact on the transportation industry this year.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tEveryone involved in <a href=\"\/freight-services\/truckload\">truckload shipping <\/a>is continuing to feel the capacity squeeze as we approach the midway point of 2014, and it&rsquo;s a complicated cocktail of causes that have combined to create this unique capacity situation that&rsquo;s quite unlike any we&rsquo;ve ever seen before.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the first quarter, 390 trucking companies went out of business, taking 10,650 for-hire trucks off the road. That may not seem like very many, but to put it in perspective&hellip; there are approximately 180,000 interstate trucks licensed to haul freight in the US. Roughly 50% of those trucks belong to private fleets, meaning <strong>over 11% of America&rsquo;s for-hire trucks <\/strong>were lost in the first quarter due to truckload carriers going out of business.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs if that&rsquo;s not enough&hellip; the insane winter weather experienced across the US, particularly the &ldquo;Polar Vortex,&rdquo; introduced a completely different set of issues. The service delays and backlogged shipments experienced due to the nasty weather are no secret, but another factor that came into play is interesting and unexpected: part of the Q1 capacity crunch was due to intermodal (rail) shippers turning to truckload in the midst of the winter storms.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tOrdinarily, the railways are a hardy and reliable form of transport in bad weather, with trains often able to keep rolling when icy highways might put trucks temporarily out of commission. However, the ferocity and never-ending pummel of winter storms had a huge impact on the rails, leaving desperate companies who normally ship all their product via rail searching for a solution. That solution ended up being shipping over-the-road, and with a sudden influx of new truckload shippers in addition to the added burden of harsh weather, spot market rates increased a staggering<strong> 20%<\/strong> in the first quarter!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tYet another factor contributing to the capacity issue is a truck driver shortage that is becoming more and more severe. As of March 2014, there were over 30,000 unfilled driver positions in the US. Large truckload carriers are actually going out of their way to strategically acquire smaller carriers just so they can acquire their drivers. The driver shortage has been compounding year after year, and there is no hope of a resolution any time soon.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\tBut wait, there&rsquo;s more! Recent legislation, including the new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/how-the-new-hours-of-service-rule-affects-shippers\">HOS regulations<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/the-map-21-act-how-it-could-affect-your-business\">MAP-21 Act<\/a>, have decreased carrier productivity by 3%-5% - and will continue to have an impact when strict equipment regulations go into effect in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo while capacity ebbs and flows, this may be one of the longest stretches of tight capacity we&rsquo;re ever going to witness. The way things are trending, industry experts are theorizing that the capacity crunch will not let up any time soon, even by the end of 2014.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNow, you&rsquo;re probably thinking: <strong>what can I do to avoid the financial impact of rising transportation costs and the added stress of trying to find trucks in this market?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\n\tThere are two major strategies that will be vital for you to save money and effort during this uncertain time. First: if you work directly with asset-based carriers, stay away from the spot market. This is where rates are rising and competition is high. Don&rsquo;t ask carriers for a one-time quote or shipment unless something fell through and you&rsquo;re seriously desperate. Develop relationships with carriers and book your loads as far in advance as possible.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, you can work with a non-asset based 3PL like Trinity to feel more confident about having available equipment for your shipments. When you work directly with carriers, trying to find a truck on your own can be like looking for a needle in a haystack, but we have over 30,000 authorized carriers in our network &ndash; leave the hard work of finding a truck (and a reasonable rate) up to us. There&rsquo;s no better time to turn to a 3PL than a time of tight capacity.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<br \/>\n\t<em>Sources:<br \/>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dcvelocity.com\/articles\/2010414-analyst-says-truckload-contract-rate-hikes-could-easily-exceed-4-to-6-percent-in-2014\/\">&ldquo;Analyst says truckload contract rate hikes could easily exceed 4 to 6 percent in 2014,&rdquo; DC Velocity<\/a><br \/>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.truckinginfo.com\/channel\/fleet-management\/news\/story\/2014\/05\/tight-capacity-pushes-trucking-conditions-index-higher.aspx\">&ldquo;Tight Capacity Pushes Trucking Conditions Index Higher,&rdquo; Truckinginfo.com<\/a><br \/>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.scdigest.com\/ontarget\/14-05-06-2.php?cid=8033\">&ldquo;Q1 2014 Truckload Carrier Review,&rdquo; Supply Chain Digest<\/a><br \/>\n\t<a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/05\/14\/us-commodities-usa-truck-idUSBREA4D04820140514\">&ldquo;As U.S. trucks revved up amid train traffic jam, a capacity crisis revealed,&rdquo; Reuters<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"slidebox\">\n\t<a class=\"close\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/form-the-carrier-capacity-crunch?utm_source=SlideInCTA&amp;utm_medium=TruckloadCapacity2014Blog&amp;utm_campaign=CTA\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}carriercapacity-slidein.jpg\" style=\"width: 90%; height: auto; border: none;\" \/><\/a><\/div>"}, {"ID":"440","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Intermodal Shipping: A Solution for Sustainability","url_title":"the-shipping-solution-for-sustainability-intermodal","entry_date":"1400689440","exerpt":"When your company's business depends on shipping freight, it's easy to feel like you have no choice but to negatively impact the environment, due to the inevitable fuel consumption and carbon emissions of the trucking industry.

The rail industry is fully aware of this and has made continued strides to further increase fuel efficiency, resulting in a 94% fuel efficiency increase since 1980. An intermodal train can move one ton of freight roughly 830 miles on a single gallon - yes, just one gallon - of diesel fuel.

They came up with nothing.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt wasn&rsquo;t until 1942 that an engineer from Derbyshire, England named Barnes Wallis came up with a solution to this problem while skipping marbles across a pond in his garden. He invented what came to be known as the &ldquo;bouncing bomb&rdquo;.&nbsp; This ingenious design was essentially an oil drum filled with explosives that was mounted laterally on the belly of an RAF bomber. Flying at 240mph, 60 feet above the water, the bomb was given backspin prior to being dropped.&nbsp; The result was a bomb that literally skipped over the surface of the water (and the torpedo nets that lay below) until it hit the dam, where the remaining backspin kept it tight against the dam while it sank and ultimately exploded.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo how is it that the RAF spent four years trying to solve this problem, but were unsuccessful until Mr. Wallis finally figured it out?&nbsp; The answer, I believe, can be traced back to &ldquo;the curse of knowledge&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn a <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.hbr.org\/2013\/04\/the-innovator-who-knew-too-muc\/\">great article<\/a> on this topic, Andy Zynga explains: &ldquo;Cognitive biases are very human and arise from our need to make sense of a situation before deciding on a course of action.

Not surprisingly, with every subsequent challenge, our response is increasingly shaped by our knowledge of <strong>how we&rsquo;ve always done it<\/strong>.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSimply put&hellip; the wealth of knowledge and experience the RAF team had? It was actually working against them, because they were unable to break away from what they believed the solution <em>should<\/em> look like. Barnes Wallis had the technical skill set, but was not limited by past experience of \"how he had always done it,\" and because of that, he was able to create an innovative and elegant solution to the problem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn very much the same way, a multi-modal 3PL provider like Trinity Logistics might be able to shed light on the supply chain innovation you need, but haven&rsquo;t quite been able to put your finger on.

A huge one: The technology involved is fairly advanced and takes much of the worry and stress out of the process. When you ship your freight via refrigerated intermodal, the containers are enabled with 24\/7 satellite tracking, internal temperature monitoring, and the ability to remotely change the temperature of the containers.

The hurricane had an extreme impact on transportation up and down the East Coast.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}katrina.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 127px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;\" \/>Hurricane Katrina<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tPredictably enough, Hurricane Katrina definitely makes the list. The most expensive hurricane in US history and the most deadly hurricane to strike since the 1920&#39;s, this deadly storm hit the Gulf Coast in 2005 and is now a historically famous disaster. Although the hurricane is remembered mainly for the death and destruction it caused, it also had a huge impact on the transportation industry - not just truckload, but rail and sea as well. Important railroad bridges were destroyed, ports were inaccessible - Katrina essentially cut off the entire Gulf Coast and made it temporarily inaccessible to the rest of the nation and world.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}flood.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;\" \/>2011 Missouri River Flood<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tIn May of 2011, at the upper Missouri River basin, one entire year&#39;s worth of rain fell. This, combined with record snowfall in the nearby Rocky Mountains, meant all six Missouri River dams were completely overloaded. This led to the longest flood event in US history - 82 days of flooding. Over 60 miles of highway in Iowa were closed for a whopping five months. This detour added 150 miles to the trip between Kansas City, MO and Sioux Falls, SD. Truckers traveling lanes in that area had to make major detours and add extra miles and time to their trips for an extended period of time.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}polar.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 150px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;\" \/>Polar Vortex<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tNo one has yet forgotten the Polar Vortex, the extreme winter weather that impacted a large portion of the US this past winter. This weather event was unique largely because of its widespread effects. Unlike a blizzard that only impacts a small portion of the country, this period of harsh cold and winter storms made lives miserable all up and down the East Coast, stretching out to the Midwest and Canada. Beyond the transportation delays caused by the snow and ice, produce season was seriously delayed this year due to the incredibly late winter, with cold temperatures reaching far into spring.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhen an extreme weather disaster strikes, it&#39;s important to know you have a reliable logistics provider on your side.

Ordinarily predictable seasonal trends have been skewed due to unforeseen events. The harsh winter weather that impacted the entire US this year delayed produce season significantly. Now we&rsquo;re facing another shift in the beginning of a season, this time sooner rather than later: intermodal peak season.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGenerally, peak season for intermodal begins much later in the year, as imports increase due to the upcoming holiday season (you can read about the reasons behind peak season and how it normally works in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/what-to-expect-during-intermodal-peak-season\">our previous blog on the subject<\/a>). However, June is the magic month this year because buyers and importers are all rushing to get their goods through the West Coast ports before June 30.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThis year is the year that the labor agreement contract for the West Coast longshoremen (men who load and unload the cargo ships at the ports) expires, and it&rsquo;s up on June 30. Sometimes the contract is good for three years, sometimes it&rsquo;s good for six years, but whenever it runs out, shippers scramble to avoid the disruption in service that always occurs. If negotiations aren&rsquo;t met by the deadline (which they rarely are), the longshoremen go on strike, causing a disruption on the West Coast ports, especially in California. (Learn more about the negotiations on this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joc.com\/port-news\/longshoreman-labor\/international-longshore-and-warehouse-union\/us-west-coast-labor-negotiations-frequently-asked-questions\">FAQ page<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHow does this affect <a href=\"\/freight-services\/intermodal\">intermodal shipping<\/a>? In short, it means shipping from the West Coast is experiencing a huge spike in supply and demand, while shipping to the West Coast will be more affordable than ever (because the intermodal carriers want their equipment empty there.) Rail is a popular way to transport West Coast imports. According to data from the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, the amount of goods imported through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and then loaded into intermodal equipment has grown 25 percent since 2006.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe 20&rsquo; and 40&rsquo; steamship containers are transloaded onto the 53&rsquo; rail containers and then moved inland (this is so that the 20&rsquo; and 40&rsquo; containers can immediately move back overseas, rather than moving inland.) Roughly 2\/3 of the intermodal containers coming off the West Coast will be from import traffic, which is huge, meaning the supply of 53&rsquo; containers heading east is limited during peak season.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news: if you&rsquo;re a high volume intermodal shipper, you may not be affected. If you ship frequently enough that you&rsquo;ve secured long-term rates with us (or whomever your intermodal provider is), this increased demand should not impact your pricing.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you&rsquo;re an infrequent intermodal shipper, you are the one who could be impacted the most, because you&rsquo;re subject to spot market pricing. Here are some tips to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Book your shipments as far in advance as possible, locking in your rate as far in advance as possible.<\/strong> Prices are extremely volatile during this time, and the rate to move a shipment over the rail can increase by hundreds of dollars over the course of a single day. Do not wait until the last minute to get a rate quote and book your freight.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Keep in mind that while shipments from the West Coast to East Coast will be a hot commodity, shipments into California (or other terminals on the West Coast) will be priced very attractively during this time.<\/strong> All the intermodal carriers want to get their equipment back to the West Coast, because that&rsquo;s where the demand is &ndash; so pricing for shipments going to the West Coast will likely be better than ever during this peak season. If you need to ship out to California and you&rsquo;ve never tried intermodal, now would be a great time.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Stay up to date on what&rsquo;s happening in the industry.<\/strong> A simple Google search for &ldquo;longshoremen strike&rdquo; will help you stay in the loop on port disruptions. Once they have come to terms on a new labor agreement, this spike in intermodal supply and demand will simmer down a bit (at least until September.)<\/p>\n<p>\n\tGot any questions?

According to the US Theft Report released by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cargonet.com\">CargoNet<\/a> in 2013, ninety-nine million dollars in cargo theft losses were reported! However, theft is only one part of the overall picture. Fraudulent pickups, double brokering, and scams involving advances paid for services rendered make up a network of scammers so profitable, it&rsquo;s reaping rewards for the scammers while leaving innocent parties to clean up the mess.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAs a top logistics company and leading third party logistics provider, we are always on the cutting edge of trends, keeping a watchful eye on fraud and ways to prevent it when our customers <a href=\"\/freight-services\">ship freight<\/a>. We&rsquo;ve invested in a partnership with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cargonet.com\">CargoNet<\/a>, whose&nbsp; purpose is to prevent cargo theft and increase recovery rates through secure and controlled information sharing among theft victims, their business partners, and law enforcement. Our standard operating procedures are ever-changing to stay ahead of the scammers, and we take the time to educate our customers, the shippers, on how to stay smart and protect themselves against fraud.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tCurrently, the top scams we&rsquo;ve seen and heard about include identity theft. A scammer will call a legitimate broker posing as a trucking company, having stolen the identity of the unaware party, in order to accept a load. They will in turn double broker the shipment, or arrange another trucking company to actually come pick it up. After it&rsquo;s loaded, they often call the legitimate broker to collect an advance on the payment, typically 40% of the load&rsquo;s negotiated price! After delivery, the legit carrier never gets paid, and comes back to the shipper to collect only to find out everyone was scammed. Other times, they don&rsquo;t collect an advance, but use the signed bill of lading to collect in full. The end result is the same. How can you protect yourself?<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t1) Check the doors<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tDid you know that by law, every motor carrier must have their trucking company name and US DOT# or MC# on the side of their truck? It is usually found on the door of the cab. If the name on the side of the truck does not match to the name of the company you hired or your freight broker arranged on your behalf, red sirens should go off with your dock workers. We highly encourage you to create a process by which you require your loaders to inspect the door personally to match the two names and if there is a discrepancy, do not load the truck until it&rsquo;s been ironed out.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t2) Verify employment<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tVerify that the employee or agent representing a logistics company is truly an authorized representative for the company they claim to be employed with. Contact the company through their website and ask to speak to Human Resources or Agent Support in order to verify employment or an agent agreement exists. If they&rsquo;ve never heard of the person, something is terribly wrong, but you&rsquo;ve prevented being scammed!<\/p>\n<h2>\n\t3) Contact the company<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tContact references, not by the number given to you by the representative, but by calling the number listed on the company&rsquo;s website. If they&rsquo;ve provided logistics services for the company, the operator can connect you to the right person and you will realize you&rsquo;re working with a legitimate provider. Otherwise, they could have given you a fellow scammer&rsquo;s number to provide a fake reference.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFor more information on preventing fraud in logistics, feel free to call our Claims Department, led by <a href=\"mailto:amy.herr@trinitylogistics.com\">Amy Herr<\/a> at (800) 846-3400, ext. 3873.&nbsp; Also, check out our other blog on the subject: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/fighting-fraud-in-transportation\">&ldquo;Fighting Fraud in Transportation&rdquo;<\/a>.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"456","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Freight Shipping Companies: What's the Difference Between Asset Based and Non-Asset Based?","url_title":"freight-shipping-companies-whats-the-difference-between-asset-based-and-non","entry_date":"1404308460","exerpt":"The debate about which kind of provider is \u201cbetter\u201d \u2013 asset based or non-asset based \u2013 has been ongoing for years.

Conversely, freight brokers and 3PLs, like Trinity Logistics, are non-asset based companies. We have no equipment and simply act as the middle man between the asset-based carriers and customers like you, in order to arrange the shipment of your freight.<\/p>\n\n<p>The debate about which kind of provider is &ldquo;better&rdquo; &ndash; asset based or non-asset based &ndash; has been ongoing for years. Some argue that they&rsquo;ll only work with asset based carriers, others swear by sourcing everything to a single 3PL, and a good amount of companies work with a mix of both kinds of providers. When you&rsquo;re trying to decide which type of provider is a good fit for your business, weighing the pros and cons can be difficult when you haven&rsquo;t had the experience of working with both.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are four major areas where working with a non-asset based 3PL, like Trinity, is beneficial:<\/p>\n\n<h2>Single-Source, Multimodal Service<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a larger company, you might be shipping a mix of truckload, LTL, and intermodal freight. Working with asset based providers means you&rsquo;re working with separate truckload carriers, LTL carriers, and intermodal carriers. That can get a little complicated. A multimodal 3PL like Trinity offers all of the above shipping services, so you can rely on one single point of contact for all your shipping needs. This is very convenient, for instance, when you want to compare the cost of moving a shipment over the road vs. over the rail &ndash; you can do that in a single step, rather than reaching out to multiple <a href=\"\/freight-services\">freight shipping companies<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Truckload Capacity and Carrier Sourcing<\/h2>\n\n<p>In the world of <a href=\"\/freight-services\/truckload\">truckload shipping<\/a>, capacity is unpredictable. Currently, truckload carriers are still recovering from the harsh, long winter in the US, compounding with a delayed produce season. When you consider the severe driver shortage that&rsquo;s only worsening, it&rsquo;s clear that truckload capacity is something to worry about.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is where working with a non-asset based provider comes in handy. We&rsquo;re the ones who find the truck &ndash; not you. Conversely, when you work directly with an asset based carrier, you have access to the capacity of their own fleet only. Our network of over 30,000 carriers is ready and waiting to help move your freight, and a network of that size is simply beyond what most companies have access to.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Carrier Compliance<\/h2>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than unknowingly shipping freight with a carrier who is uninsured, a scammer, or non-compliant with government rules and regulations &ndash; especially if an accident or theft occurs. Unless your staff has the time and resources to thoroughly vet each asset-based carrier to verify their credentials and compliance, working directly with asset-based carriers may introduce unnecessary risk into your supply chain. Any approved carrier in our network has gone through an intense approval process, so working with Trinity (or any reputable 3PL who follows a similar carrier vetting procedure) may save you a potential headache down the road.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Nationwide Network<\/h2>\n\n<p>Unless it&rsquo;s one of the larger asset based carriers, many carriers only have a presence in one portion of the country, or only prefer to run certain lanes. A huge benefit of working with an established 3PL or freight broker is that no equipment means no boundaries. For example, we have over 90 offices spread across the US and Canada, so we can virtually service any lane, thanks to our expansive carrier network. The same will be the case for any other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\">top logistics companies<\/a>. You won&rsquo;t have to spend extra time calling certain carriers for certain lanes, or searching for a new carrier when you open that new distribution center across the country.<\/p>\n\n<p>Are there benefits to working with asset based providers, too? Absolutely. The best decision for your company will simply depend on your circumstances, your logistics department, and the kind of service you require.

There are software companies whose sole purpose is to develop and sell TMS software, and there are 3PL (third party logistics) companies who offer TMS software as just one element of the many other logistics and transportation services they provide. Our company, Trinity Logistics, is a great example of a 3PL who offers a TMS to their customers, while also offering other services &ndash; primarily freight arrangement.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are distinct differences, and sometimes advantages, to working with a certain kind of TMS provider, depending on your circumstances. Particularly, sourcing your TMS through a 3PL provider can have some major benefits, especially for small- to medium-sized businesses.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the past, implementing a TMS was usually out of reach if your company was not of a certain size &ndash; but new, scalable options in the TMS world have made this powerful software an option for more companies than ever.&nbsp; For this reason, deploying a TMS is typically a new experience for small- to mid-sized companies, and working directly with a software provider can be intimidating if that&rsquo;s the case. Logistics is often not a core competency for smaller companies, and they need an extra hand in determining the best solution for them.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Generally, a 3PL will work with your team to deploy a system that specifically meets your needs, while a software company is more likely to offer an &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; solution. That&rsquo;s perfectly fine, if you know exactly what you are looking for. But for smaller companies with less logistics experience, it can be overwhelming. A 3PL can help fill the knowledge gaps and ensure your investment is valuable and will have ROI.<\/p>\n\n<p>This difference can also have an impact on the cost of implementation. Software companies tend to consider a customized solution as more work for their implementation team, which translates into person hours, which translates into higher implementation fees for your company. When working with a 3PL, you&rsquo;re also &ldquo;hiring&rdquo; their insight and experience as part of the implementation process. An experienced 3PL can guide you through the process and advise the best options for your company, and that&#39;s not considered an additional service. Again, this may not be required for companies with very experienced and knowledgable logistics departments - especially if they have implemented a TMS before - but it&#39;s extremely valuable for businesses who may be doing this for the first time.<\/p>\n\n<p>To learn more about obtaining a TMS from a 3PL like Trinity, you can get in touch with us <a href=\"\/request-a-consultation\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<div id=\"slidebox\">\n\t<a class=\"close\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/request-a-consultation?utm_source=SlideInCTA&amp;utm_medium=HowtoChooseTMSProviderBlog&amp;utm_campaign=CTA\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}TMS-slidein.jpg\" style=\"width: 90%; height: auto; border: none;\" \/><\/a><\/div>"}, {"ID":"466","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Guest Blog: Understanding the Metrics of LTL Capacity","url_title":"guest-blog-understanding-the-metrics-of-ltl-capacity","entry_date":"1406305260","exerpt":"Scott Harrison, Manager of Sales, Support and Development at Southeastern Freight Lines, shares the three metrics that have an impact on LTL carrier capacity.","content":"<p>\n\tAs a purchaser of LTL shipping services, should you be worried about a capacity crunch in the LTL industry?&nbsp; Capacity really has three distinct components, and any one of them could create a reduction in capacity. This can quickly lead to slower service, and then result in rate increases, as the more profitable shipments will gain preference over those moving at break-even or with low margins.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tEquipment Availability<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tThe first of the three variables is equipment availability &ndash; tractors and trailers.&nbsp; This is the easiest of the three to remedy by carriers, as rental equipment is almost always available and can be used short-term to handle seasonal surges in traffic.&nbsp; However, the operating costs will increase with leased equipment, and on-board computers will not be available in those units, causing a reduction in visibility of the real-time movement of your shipments.&nbsp; An LTL carrier in good condition and prepared for the future will be happy to share the average age of the fleet, trade cycles and capital expenditures on equipment, currently and in the future.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tAvailable Drivers<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tThe second component: available drivers and dock associates are critical to maintain service levels and keep shipments moving on schedule.&nbsp; The trucking industry is experiencing a driver shortage, and it is expected to become much more severe during the coming decade.&nbsp; The truckload segment is the first to feel this shortage, as the long-haul, over the road drivers quickly burn out with the long hours and time away from home.&nbsp; Many of the larger truckload carriers have no planned expansion to their fleets as they cannot keep sufficient drivers in the seats of their current fleet.&nbsp; The turnover rates range from 70% to more than 100% per year.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLTL carriers have an advantage in this department, as the majority of drivers return home daily. The most successful LTL carriers have loyal and long-term associates bred by a culture of appreciation, great equipment, strong wages and a team environment.&nbsp; These drivers tend to be the safest, the most productive and the most customer-friendly in the business. These companies frequently have in-house driver training programs to move associates with a proven record into a driving role.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tService Centers<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tThe third and most challenging factor is available infrastructure, defined as the network of service centers.&nbsp; These must be located in the correct locations and be large enough with sufficient dock doors.&nbsp; In the LTL business, shipments move very quickly and trailers must be put to the dock on arrival for rapid unloading.&nbsp; If a service center does not have enough dock doors, shipments will be slower to be cross-docked, close out times will be missed, dispatches will be late and your shipment will be delayed.&nbsp; Sometimes a 30 minute delay along the way can cause a full day delay for your shipment.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem is that it takes a very long time to add service centers to an LTL network, as property needs to be secured that is in the right location, has the correct zoning (who wants a trucking terminal as a neighbor?) and has enough acreage to build a large service center.&nbsp; This property can be virtually impossible to find in many major markets today.&nbsp; The permitting and construction gestation period can take years to complete.&nbsp; The carriers that are best prepared will have a complete service network with more than enough dock doors to move shipments on schedule.&nbsp; These carriers will be making land purchases 5 to 10 years prior to the need just to be sure the property is available when needed.&nbsp; The goal should be to never have &ldquo;choke points&rdquo; anywhere in the country where shipments could be delayed.&nbsp; As a customer, you don&rsquo;t want to hear excuses about backlogs of shipments caused by a service center structure that is not big enough to move every shipment in a timely manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\tAs a customer, you should be asking all your carriers questions to validate their capacity, both today and in the future.&nbsp; Look at the equipment as drivers come to your location to be sure it is new, clean and in good condition.&nbsp; Walk inside an empty trailer or two and you will quickly see a difference in quality as equipment ages.&nbsp; Talk to the drivers who pick up and deliver at your location and ask if they are happy with their employer and why.&nbsp; Most of these drivers are not bashful and will share a story or two about their company.&nbsp; When it comes to infrastructure, plan a visit to each carrier you are using in your city and judge for yourself.&nbsp; If you just can&rsquo;t get away or the carrier won&rsquo;t extend an invitation, Google Maps will give you a good basis for comparison.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIn the carrier selection process, don&rsquo;t be seduced by the &ldquo;discount game&rdquo; but look for those carriers that are professional and prepared to handle your shipments both tomorrow and five or ten years from now.&nbsp; Look for no &ldquo;choke points&rdquo;, a professional driver in a modern tractor with all the newest technology, and a service center that can move all shipments on-time.&nbsp; That is what you are buying and that is what you and your customers deserve.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Many thanks to Scott Harrison at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sefl.com\">Southeastern Freight Lines<\/a> for contributing this blog.

However, you won&rsquo;t see ROI in your TMS investment unless you&rsquo;re actively taking advantage of the visibility it provides. You now have the power to view, analyze, and take action on a huge range of data. Actively monitoring and making decisions based on these reports will be key to creating efficiencies and cutting costs.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIt may be overwhelming trying to decide exactly which data you should be analyzing. According to our TMS team, these are the top five reports you should absolutely be running:<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tFreight Accruals<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tFreight accruals are used to keep track of the costs associated with the transportation of your goods to a customer. Costs are accrued from the moment the goods are delivered, and they are discharged once the freight invoice has been paid. Tracking freight accruals allows your company to calculate your true net revenue at any given time by providing insight into any outstanding balances that have accumulated during a specific timeframe.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}acrruals.png\" style=\"width: 330px; height: 544px;\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>\n\tCost Allocation<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tCost allocation reports break your freight charges down by the mile, the pound, or the SKU.&nbsp; For multi-stop loads (or loads made up of multiple POs), freight charges can be allocated to each order based on the percentage of distance, weight, or quantity the individual order contributed to the whole. Tracking cost allocations will give your company valuable insight into the true cost of transporting goods and can be used to identify costly SKUs or lanes.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}costallocation.png\" style=\"width: 680px; height: 277px;\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>\n\tCarrier Scorecard<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tCarrier scorecards are used to track a carrier&rsquo;s performance based on their tender acceptance, on-time pickups, and on-time deliveries. Carriers who bid low on an RFP and then proceed to decline tenders or provide poor service can either cost your company thousands of dollars in additional expenses or, worse yet, cause you to lose customers. Tracking carriers&rsquo; performance can help you reevaluate your routing guide by selecting more reliable carriers on trouble lanes, improving both costs and customer service.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}carrier_scorecard.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 508px;\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>\n\tLeast Cost Carriers<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tLeast cost carrier reports are used to identify loads where the carrier with the lowest cost did not haul the freight, the reason why, and the additional freight charges that occurred as a result. By tracking least cost carrier usage, your company can identify potential problem areas, resolve the underlying issues, and prevent unnecessary expenses from occurring in the future. If you are looking to cut freight costs, this report makes it clear and simple to see missed opportunities where money could have been saved. Since cost isn&#39;t the only factor when selecting a carrier, you can also use this report to identify carriers who are repeatedly passed over despite offering lower rates, providing an opportunity to work with these carriers to set up a service level agreement before you decide to award business solely based on cost.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}leastcostcarrier.png\" style=\"width: 680px; height: 324px;\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>\n\tPower Lanes<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tPower lane reports are used to identify new lanes and provide a benchmark for negotiating contracted rates with carriers. You can identify a new lane as an origin-destination pairing that occurs a set number of times. Once a new lane has been identified, the spot market rates paid to move the lane can be broken down by load, mileage, pound, etc. and can be used as a point of reference when negotiating rates with carriers. By identifying power lanes, you can secure fixed rates on a lane, making it easier to predict future freight costs.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Note: Most transportation management software products have the ability to run the five reports listed above.

Other times, it&rsquo;s looked upon for consolidating shipments or enhancing the way a shipment is being routed. While these are definite features, a TMS also provides opportunities for savings in both soft and hard costs that create far-reaching benefits for your entire company, not just the transportation department. The TMS has a dramatic positive effect on the profitability of all departments. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how.<\/p>\n\n<p>Transportation management software can have the following effects on your total expenses:<\/p>\n\n<h2>Reduce inventory costs<\/h2>\n\n<p>Through integration with existing ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software and WMS (Warehouse Management System) software, a TMS can ensure accurate shipments of product(s) are tracked and removed from inventory. This allows correct inventory levels for planning purposes and therefore reduces the need to carry &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; inventory. It will also help you avoid the need for additional separate shipments.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Reduce wasted employment expenses<\/h2>\n\n<p>Since a TMS can automatically track and trace, it reduces the time required by employees to do so. By reducing the time it takes your employees to manually track shipments, it saves on employment expense, reduces overtime costs, as well as increases employee productivity.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Reduce services provided to less profitable customers<\/h2>\n\n<p>A TMS can track transportation cost down to the granular level. Since it can do this it allows a company to determine the total cost of a customer, compare it against revenue by customer and truly determine the profitability (or loss) of the customer. Perhaps this will allow you to adjust what is included in the sales agreement such as excessive lumper fees or detention. It can also identify where you may need to stop providing certain discounts or increase their cost to accommodate shipping expenses.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Reduce handling costs<\/h2>\n\n<p>With its ability to optimize and consolidate shipments, a TMS reduces the number of shipments and as such, you&rsquo;re reducing the amount of hands required to touch the shipment and therefore lowering handling costs.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Reduce personnel costs<\/h2>\n\n<p>Without a TMS, daily operations can require significant fixed cost wages or salaries of the people equipped to handle logistics. With a TMS, many processes can be automated and outsourced to the point where it requires less personnel, allowing you to reassign staff to more productive roles or avoid adding additional salaries.<\/p>\n\n<p>Example: Your TMS receives an order from an ERP electronically and notifies the WMS all within the blink of an eye. The WMS notifies warehouse personnel to pick, pack, and prepare for shipment. Once the shipment is ready for pick-up, the WMS notifies the TMS which automatically tenders the load and notifies the carrier. Overall, the requirement of human involvement and management has been minimized to exception management.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Avoid increasing physical network\/facilities costs<\/h2>\n\n<p>As a TMS automates processes and integrates with other tools, just-in-time order fulfillment can become a reality! As a result, you&rsquo;re able to reduce the amount of inventory stored &ldquo;on hand&rdquo; which decreases your need for more square footage and larger networks.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Leverage new and\/or alternative distribution channels<\/h2>\n\n<p id=\"last\">Through optimization using a TMS, we can determine if your shipments qualify to be shipped through alternative modes such as LTL and intermodal. Alternative modes often carry significant cost savings.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Reduce billing costs<\/h2>\n\n<p>A TMS can automatically handle billing and is able to be integrated with your company&rsquo;s software which may result in a faster billing and payment cycle without the additional costs of collections staff or agencies.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are just a few areas of expense that a TMS can have a positive effect on.

The FMCSA, which regulates laws for the trucking industry in the United States, has had an incredibly eventful five years during her tenure &ndash; but simultaneously, has experienced a rapidly declining reputation in the trucking industry. While her resignation prompts relief for many, it prompts questions and concerns for others about the future direction of the FMCSA. Will Ferro&rsquo;s desired legacy live on, or will her successor work toward different goals for the organization?<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFerro was arguably the most controversial leader in the history of the organization, and during the five years that she held the role, a significant volume of industry-changing legislation was passed into law. Much of this legislation sparked controversy amongst trucking industry organizations. In a farewell interview with the media on August 14th, Ferro stressed that she wouldn&rsquo;t have done a single thing differently during her tenure and that she hopes her successor will continue on with the same driven focus and goals she had: &ldquo;to protect the public.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>\n\tFerro&rsquo;s last day is this Monday, August 25th. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the accomplishments of the FMCSA during her tenure and the controversy sparked by some of those endeavors.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tTimeline<\/h2>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>March 2010<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tA national ban on texting and driving was approved for commercial truck drivers. Many large carriers already had policies in place that prohibited their drivers from texting while driving, and the danger of texting while driving is obvious, so this was not a significantly controversial ruling.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>December 2010<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tThe FMCSA&rsquo;s new rating system for carriers, CSA (Compliance, Safety, Accountability) went live. This monumental new program rates trucking companies on several factors, adding up to an overall safety score that is not only used to determine whether the company can remain in operation, but can also be used by freight brokers or freight shippers (manufacturers\/distributors) as a benchmark for whether a carrier operates &ldquo;safely&rdquo; enough to haul their freight. Some companies have a certain required score in mind that a carrier must meet to be approved to do business with them.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhile this created an easy, new way to quickly gain perspective on a carrier&rsquo;s history, some parties feel that the different factors and the amounts which those factors are weighted to make up the CSA score are unfair or illogical.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>January 2011<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tThe FMCSA proposed legislation that would require every single commercial vehicle to be equipped with an EOBR (electronic on-board recorder). There were many problems with the proposal, so this was thrown out by a federal appeals court in August 2011 &ndash; temporarily.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>October 2011<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tA three-year pilot program was launched to allow certain approved Mexican truck drivers to cross the border. Previously, all freight had to be trans-loaded at the border and picked up by an American driver in order to continue on the journey. In removing that extra step, freight hauled by these specially approved Mexican carriers can make a much quicker journey across the border.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>November 2011<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tThe DOT announced that, effective January 2012, truck drivers would face the risk of losing their CDL and fines up to $2,750 if caught using a handheld cell phone while driving.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>December 2011<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tThe official announcement of the new, final <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/how-the-new-hours-of-service-rule-affects-shippers\">HOS (hours of service) rule<\/a> came this month, which dictates how much and how often truckers can drive each week. These rules were modified in an attempt to reduce the number of fatigue-related crashes. The new rule includes an 11-hour driving limit and a 34-hour restart rule.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThis caused a huge amount of backlash from trucking companies and organizations, who feared reduced productivity due to the new rules. Many also felt the rules were created based on inaccurate, biased, or incomplete research and statistics, and with a lack of understanding of the trucking industry.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>July 2013<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tDespite pushback from the ATA (American Trucking Association) and other organizations, the new HOS requirements went live on July 1. The new rules limited drivers to 70 hours a week, with a 34-hour rest period that must include two 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. periods. The 34-hour restart rule was the most controversial aspect of the new law, and efforts to repeal it are still ongoing today.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>October 2013<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tThe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/the-map-21-act-how-it-could-affect-your-business\">MAP-21 Act<\/a> was signed into law and went into effect, including 29 new rules from the FMCSA; the ruling to mandate all commercial vehicles be equipped with EOBR&rsquo;s (electronic on-board recorders) was included and passed with this legislation, and now many small trucking companies fear they may go out of business due to not being able to afford the expensive EOBR. The Act also increased the required freight broker bond from $10,000 to $75,000, pushing many small freight brokers out of the game, as well.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tImpact of FMCSA Rulings on Manufacturers &amp; Distributors<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tFor companies who aren&rsquo;t trucking companies, but rather manufacturers and distributors who rely on trucking to get their product where it needs to go, it can be difficult to understand the implications of all this legislation and the direct impact it may have on your business. The FMCSA has taken many steps over the past 5 years to get unsafe drivers and noncompliant carriers off the road, and that may provide you with peace of mind when arranging the transport of your freight.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tYou also may have noticed some negative implications, especially due to the new HOS rules; transporting freight simply takes longer now. For companies who had strategically placed their distribution centers certain distances apart based on the HOS driving allowances, their supply chains were flipped upside down when those DC&rsquo;s could no longer be reached in one trip without breaking HOS rules. And due to a 3%-5% decrease in carrier productivity (due to HOS compliance), <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/truckload-capacity-in-2014-a-grim-reality\">truckload capacity <\/a>is tighter now than it was before.<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">For more information about the direct impact of some of these rulings on your business, check out our blog posts on <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/how-the-new-hours-of-service-rule-affects-shippers\" style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">the Hours of Service rule<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/the-map-21-act-how-it-could-affect-your-business\" style=\"line-height: 1.45; font-size: 14.5px;\">MAP-21 Act<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tOOIDA&rsquo;s Call For Ferro&rsquo;s Resignation<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tIn June, OOIDA (the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association) sent a letter to the Secretary of Transportation openly calling for Ferro to resign. OOIDA president Jim Johnston stated that Ferro had a &ldquo;clear bias against truckers and the trucking industry&rdquo; and that the agency &ldquo;can no longer perform its regulatory and enforcement duties impartially.&rdquo; The straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back and ultimately prompted OOIDA&rsquo;s letter was a blog post published by Ferro on June 3rd, pleading with Congress not to reverse the HOS (hours of service) changes she fought so hard to have implemented. In the post, she defended her position with points that OOIDA felt were blatantly anti-trucking.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNaturally, with Ferro&rsquo;s resignation announcement coming a mere month after this incident occurred, many have speculated that the pressure from OOIDA to resign had an influence on Ferro&rsquo;s decision. However, in her farewell speech to the media on August 14th, Ferro put those rumors to rest and declared that her resignation had absolutely nothing to do with OOIDA.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tWho Will Replace Her?<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tFerro&rsquo;s last day is August 25 (this Monday). It&rsquo;s surprising that her replacement has yet to be announced, as Ferro indicated in her farewell interview that a transition plan (and her successor) would be announced while she was still in the role, so the clock is ticking. The FMCSA&rsquo;s deputy administrator, Bill Bronrott, is the highest-ranking official after Ferro; he joined the organization in 2010. Whether or not he will be appointed remains unclear.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tDepending on who is chosen for the role, the FMCSA&rsquo;s direction and goals could change drastically; while Ferro is eager for her legacy to live on, most trucking companies are undoubtedly hoping that her successor will have a drastically different vision for the organization.

Business between the US and Mexico is booming. Mexico is the US&rsquo;s third largest trading partner, after China and Canada, and the US is Mexico&rsquo;s largest trading partner. Since NAFTA implementation in 1994, US exports to Mexico have risen 223% and Mexican exports to the US have grown a huge 396%!<\/p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you are looking to export your finished goods into Mexico for sale or consumption &ndash; this is called &ldquo;definite&rdquo; importation. Alternatively, maybe you&rsquo;d like to temporarily ship raw goods into Mexico to be assembled into a final product which will be imported back into the US &ndash; this is called &ldquo;IMMEX&rdquo; importation, and it allows you to avoid being taxed on the imported goods, since they are not staying in Mexico permanently. On the other hand, perhaps you&rsquo;re importing materials from Mexico in order to manufacture your products here in the US. No matter the situation, compared to shipping domestically, there are a lot more factors you&rsquo;ll need to consider when arranging the transportation of your goods.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you ship a truckload of freight within the United States, it&rsquo;s a pretty simple process (although it may not feel like it sometimes!) In general, your freight is only loaded and unloaded once; the same truck driver and trailer brings your goods from door to door; and you don&rsquo;t need to involve any third parties, besides the carrier or freight broker. When you&rsquo;re shipping to and from Mexico, it&rsquo;s a little different.<\/p>\n\n<p>In its journey from country to country,&nbsp; a completely different carrier will be delivering your freight than the carrier who picked it up. Depending on whether you select \"door-to-door\" or \"door-to-border\" service, your freight may be loaded and unloaded multiple times onto different trailers. The services of a customs broker and freight forwarder will be required to assist with customs clearance. If you elect to use a 3PL for the arrangement of your shipments, many of these details can be taken care of for you, although you can choose to elect a customs broker or freight forwarder of your choosing, if you prefer (and the freight is being delivered to you). Who is responsible for making these third-party arrangements depends on which direction you are shipping.<\/p>\n\n<p>To break it down a little more simply, here&rsquo;s a run-down of the process when you&rsquo;re shipping <em>to<\/em> Mexico (exporting):<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>&nbsp;A US carrier will haul your freight to the border, and deliver it to the designated freight forwarder that has been selected\/hired by the Mexican consignee (the recipient of your goods.)<\/li>\n\t<li>The freight forwarder receives your shipment, inspects the cargo, reviews all the documents, and prepares the shipment to make entry into Mexico on behalf of the Mexican customs broker who is servicing your shipment.<\/li>\n\t<li>The Mexican customs broker will formally file the Mexican customs entry on behalf of the Mexican consignee.<\/li>\n\t<li>Now it&rsquo;s time for your freight to cross the border! A third party drayage company will haul your shipment over the border, through customs, and then deliver it to the selected Mexican carrier&rsquo;s facility.<\/li>\n\t<li>Finally, the Mexican carrier hauls your freight inland to its final destination in Mexico, the consignee.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>And, because it&rsquo;s a little different going the other direction, here&rsquo;s how it goes down when you&rsquo;re shipping from Mexico to the US (importing):<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>A Mexican carrier hauls your freight to the border city.<\/li>\n\t<li>A Mexican customs broker formally files the Mexican customs export entry on behalf of the Mexican shipper so that the goods can legally leave the country.<\/li>\n\t<li>Then, a licensed US customs broker clears the shipment and files the US customs entry so that the shipment may enter the US on behalf of the US importer of record (the consignee).<\/li>\n\t<li>A third party drayage company will haul your shipment over the border, through US customs, and deliver the shipment to the chosen US carrier&rsquo;s facility.<\/li>\n\t<li>The US carrier hauls the freight inland to the final destination.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s one other important thing to note:&nbsp; insurance liability for freight moving into Mexico is <em>very<\/em> different from liability in the US. All US carriers offering door-to-door service have limited or no liability coverage for shipments once they cross the border into Mexico. It&rsquo;s important to arrange additional cargo insurance for the Mexican portion of the journey, which you can usually arrange either through your logistics service provider, or through the customs broker.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve never shipped to or from Mexico before, learning about the process can certainly be a little confusing or overwhelming at times. With offices in border cities, fluent Spanish-speaking team members, and years of experience in this area of the industry, Trinity Logistics is the ideal partner to help you learn more about the process and assist you with your Mexico shipping endeavors.<\/p>\n\n<p><a class=\"button\" href=\"\/ask-a-question\">Ask us a question about Mexico shipping<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a class=\"button\" href=\"\/get-a-quote\">Get a shipping quote for Mexico shipping<\/a><\/p>"}, {"ID":"486","cat_name":null,"title":"What is Transportation Management Software?","url_title":"what-is-transportation-management-software","entry_date":"1409933520","exerpt":"A transportation management system (TMS) is a software program that allows companies to manage their supply chain (including their internal logistics department, suppliers, carriers, and vendors).

Although transportation management software was very expensive when it fi&#28;rst became popular, the new options available for on-demand, scalable TMS software mean that even smaller companies can now take advantage of the benefi&#28;ts of implementation. &#31;These benefi&#28;ts include automation, optimization, visibility, and reporting that lead to developing more e&#29;fficient logistics processes, and ultimately, time and money saved.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tCommon TMS Functions<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tAlthough there are some di&#30;fferences between the various transportation management systems available, there are some functions that are shared by almost all. Most can automate manual processes, optimize shipments, provide visibility into freight spend, and generate fi&#28;nancial and operational metric reports.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>Automation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tA TMS will allow you to eliminate manual processes that could be performed automatically. For example, by integrating the TMS with your company&rsquo;s existing ERP, order information can be automatically transferred from one system to the other, preventing the need for dual shipment entry. Once the shipment information is in the TMS, you will have the ability to perform all procurement processes automatically &ndash; including rate shopping for contracted carrier rates, requesting spot quotes from multiple carriers, selecting a preferred carrier based on rate or service, and waterfall tendering of the freight until it&rsquo;s accepted.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>Optimization<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tWith a TMS, you can analyze a batch of shipments based on a variety of sophisticated parameters in order to determine the most cost-e&#30;ffective route plan. Th&#31;e TMS can make recommendations based on least-cost mode analyses (including parcel, LTL, truckload and intermodal), shipment consolidation opportunities (including multi-pick or multi-stop loads), continuous move opportunities, and pool distribution opportunities while accounting for factors like due dates, mileage, vehicle weight, stops in transit, and out-of-route parameters.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>Visibility<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tA TMS can provide user visibility, supply chain visibility, and freight spend visibility. User visibility is controlled by setting constraints upon each user&rsquo;s login in order to control the amount of information they have access to. Supply chain visibility comes from providing each member of the supply chain (including suppliers, warehouses, carriers, vendors, etc.) with the ability to update their portion of the shipment in order to provide accurate real-time visibility into shipment status. Freight spend visibility comes from generating reports that will help you analyze your freight costs.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t<strong>Reporting<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>\n\tWith a best-in-class TMS, you can generate advanced reports that actually drill down into the very core of the speci&#28;c logistics metrics that a&#30;ffect your business&rsquo;s bottom line. Examples of reports include freight spend totals, shipment statuses, shipment volume reports, accountability reports, analyzed freight spend reports, lane analysis reports, and carrier performance reports. &#31;These reports are dynamic and can easily be fi&#28;ltered, summarized and graphed.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you believe a TMS could be beneficial for your organization, we offer<a href=\"\/request-a-consultation\"> free consultations <\/a>so you can learn more about this software and how it can help you!

Whether you&rsquo;re shipping or receiving freight, getting behind schedule can throw off the entire day. Sometimes, yes, delays are unavoidable &ndash; but you might be surprised to learn that your own company procedures could be making you more vulnerable to back-ups. Are you guilty of the &ldquo;dock jammers&rdquo; listed below? Keep reading to learn about these common culprits and how you can avoid them.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tDock Jammer #1: Requiring drivers to count the freight on the dock prior to loading<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tOf course, it&rsquo;s important to be able to confirm the amount of product that&rsquo;s been loaded onto the truck. Having the driver count the product by hand immediately before loading is the most sure-fire way to do that, right? Probably not.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, it is sometimes unrealistic to expect a driver to be able to accurately count your (already stacked and shrink wrapped) product on pallets. When the driver isn&rsquo;t the one who stacked or shrink wrapped the pallets, he may not be able to accurately determine the product count; he can only eyeball it, and he has to assume the pallets aren&rsquo;t totally hollow!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThis can become a very lengthy process, and while it&rsquo;s great for drivers to double check the pallet count, you can save time by taking care of this process entirely on your own. If your company takes on the responsibility of counting the freight and sealing the trailer, not only will you likely see more consistent numbers upon delivery, but you will save some serious time at the docks!<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tDock Jammer #2: Requiring drivers to physically load the freight onto the truck<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tMany companies who require the driver to count the freight also have the driver load the freight onto the truck. This is another policy that can make loading freight a very slow process.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe biggest reason for this? Many truck drivers just simply aren&rsquo;t experienced forklift\/pallet jack operators. They&rsquo;re truck drivers, not forklift drivers! While there are exceptions to the rule, this usually means the loading process will take longer compared to having the truck loaded by someone who operates a forklift all day, every day. Having one of your dedicated employees load the freight instead of the driver will save a lot of time &ndash; and the driver can focus on his true responsibility, safely transporting your load from point A to point B.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tDock Jammer #3: Truckload and LTL shipments ship and receive on the same docks<\/h3>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\tIf you have enough dock doors and enough variety between truckload and LTL (less than truckload) shipments, you may want to consider having one or more dock doors solely dedicated to LTL. In general, LTL carriers are in and out much faster than truckload carriers &ndash; understandably so, since the shipments are so much smaller. By making this change, you can keep your LTL shipments moving smoothly and avoid delays caused by anything on the truckload side.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tDock Jammer #4: Shipping in the mornings, receiving in the afternoons<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tReceiving in the mornings and shipping in the afternoons is a somewhat universal process in the world of trucking. If you do it backwards &ndash; ship in the mornings and receive in the afternoons &ndash; you are likely to see very little benefit from that setup. Setting your appointments in a predictable manner, not the opposite of the norm, will help keep things running smoothly and trucks arriving on time.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\tDock Jammer #5: Your appointment scheduling system is disorganized (or you don&rsquo;t schedule appointments at all)<\/h3>\n<p>\n\tWe understand it can be difficult to implement an appointment scheduling system. You lose some flexibility, and trucks can be all over the place with their ETA&rsquo;s, making it very challenging to determine a pickup or delivery appointment for them. However, not using appointment windows (or being disorganized and not sticking to what you&rsquo;ve scheduled) is truly the number one cause of delays at the docks. When you only have three dock doors and ten trucks show up at once because they&rsquo;re told it&rsquo;s first come, first serve&hellip; that&rsquo;s not going to be a fun time.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tConsider sticking to an appointment system if you are constantly seeing delays caused by too many trucks showing up at once.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you currently participate in any of this &ldquo;dock jamming&rdquo; behavior and aren&rsquo;t sure how to fix it, our logistics consultants can help!

While these tips may not be possible for everyone to implement, you&#39;ll likely find at least one or two of them are relevant to your situation!<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLet&rsquo;s get right down to it.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tMaximize the density of your shipment<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tA truck can only haul so much weight. LTL carriers make a profit by fitting as many different LTL shipments into one single trailer as possible. So which do you think they prefer... a 5,000lb shipment that takes up 25% of the space in the trailer, or a 5,000lb shipment that only takes up 10% of the space? The more space your shipment takes up in the trailer, the more you&#39;ll be charged to ship it.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the weight of your shipment is out of your control, the density is not! Do everything you can to compact your shipment and increase the density as much as possible. If your pallets are not stackable, find a way to make it so. Pack your product more densely (less empty space between cases or product on the pallet, if possible). Stack an extra row on top of each pallet to possibly eliminate an extra pallet. Brainstorm about all the ways to make your shipment take up less space, and you will definitely see a financial reward.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tConsolidate your shipments<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tShipping a full truckload of freight is often far less expensive than shipping multiple LTL shipments. Have you ever considered consolidating your LTL shipments into a multi-stop truckload shipment? Of course, it depends where your shipments are delivering - for example, a multi-stop truckload picking up in Maine and delivering in Florida, Minnesota, and California might not make financial sense compared to shipping LTL. But if your delivery points are close to each other, or if they form a line across the country (at least vaguely), getting a quote on a consolidated truckload shipment would be very wise.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tNegotiate a FAK<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tThose of you who have not heard the term \"FAK\" are probably raising your eyebrows. \"FAK\" stands for \"freight all kinds\". This literally refers to when a customer ships all kinds of freight. Let&#39;s say you ship some products at class 50, some at class 55, some at 75, and some at 150. (If you have no idea what I&#39;m talking about, go read <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/ltl-shipping-services-for-beginners-three-terms-you-should-know\">this blog<\/a> to learn about freight class.) Since your freight class impacts the cost of your LTL shipment, and getting a rate for different classes all the time can quickly become time-consuming and complicated, you actually have a different option here. We can negotiate a FAK on your behalf, which basically means you can ship all your LTL freight at the same class. Not only does this simplify things for you, it also typically results in cost savings!<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tProvide accurate information<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tMost shippers are painfully aware that the rate for shipping their LTL freight is highly dependent on the size and weight. For this reason, some people are tempted to slightly \"underestimate\" the dimensions or weight of their shipment in the hopes it will result in a slightly lower shipping cost and the LTL carrier will be none the wiser.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\tWhatever you do, DO NOT DO THIS! Rather than saving money, you&#39;re putting yourself at risk of being fined. If the carrier happens to double check the dimensions or weight of your shipment, and it doesn&#39;t match what&#39;s on the BOL... let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll be in a world of trouble. Your shipment cost will be raised accordingly, but you&#39;ll also be charged with an inspection fee, and it&#39;s possible the carrier will red-flag your freight to be inspected every single time you ever ship with them in the future.<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBy ensuring the weight, size, and all other information listed on the bill of lading is accurate, you will not be risking these extra fees.<\/p>\n<h2>\n\tIf you don&#39;t ship at a high volume, work with a 3PL<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tIf you ship a large amount of LTL freight, you can negotiate lower pricing with LTL carriers (or have a 3PL negotiate on your behalf). But what if you don&rsquo;t ship LTL that often? Does that mean you&rsquo;re stuck paying the highest rates every time you call up your LTL carrier of choice? If you work directly with LTL carriers, then yes, maybe. But a great alternative is to ship your LTL freight through a 3PL (like Trinity Logistics). Because of the high volume of freight that 3PLs arrange (all of their customers combined!) they will have the lower contracted rates available that you can take advantage of without having high volume of your own. This will result in a significant cost savings, especially over time.<\/p>\n<div id=\"slidebox\">\n\t<a class=\"close\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/trinity-topics-june14?utm_source=SlideInCTA&amp;utm_medium=LTLFiveWaysSaveMoneyBlog&amp;utm_campaign=CTA\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}LTLtopics-slidein.jpg\" style=\"width: 90%; height: auto; border: none;\" \/><\/a><\/div>"}, {"ID":"507","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"The Ultimate Collection of Trucking Infographics: 20 Infographics About the Trucking Industry","url_title":"the-ultimate-collection-of-trucking-infographics-20-infographics-about-the","entry_date":"1413558960","exerpt":"Tired of searching all over the internet for the perfect educational infographic on truck drivers or the trucking industry?

This leaves shippers wondering how this may affect their bottom line. Learn about the reasons for rising rates and how you can avoid them. ","content":"<p>With the U.S. economy strengthening, and industries booming, truck drivers are seeing some of the largest wage increases in years. As encouraging as it is for drivers to be seeing bigger paychecks, the reasoning behind the pay raises can&rsquo;t be ignored: the nationwide truck driver shortage.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why are truckers&rsquo; wages going up?<\/h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that truckload capacity has been tight lately. Truckers who were unable to afford the shortage of loads when the economy was suffering left the industry behind for jobs that allowed them to be closer to home. Not only that, but the tougher federal regulations introduced in 2013, which put tighter limits on driving hours, didn&rsquo;t exactly persuade truckers to stay in the industry. That leaves about 35,000 spots unfilled, according to the American Trucking Associations (ATA).<\/p>\n\n<p>Now that the economy is bouncing back and there is an increase in demand for goods, there is also a stronger need for getting those goods to market. A limited number of truck drivers and high demand from shippers leaves even some of the largest carriers in a scramble to get their unmanned trucks on the road.<\/p>\n\n<p id=\"last\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>With hundreds of trucks left idling and the average turnover rate for drivers with large carriers being just over 90%, fleet managers have had to make the driver&rsquo;s seat look more appealing to potential truckers. The best way to get that message across is by fattening paychecks, as well as taking on licensing costs and offering signing bonuses. This means higher salaries for those who are left, but also those in the younger generations that need to make up for the 96,000 drivers leaving every year for retirement.&nbsp; If carriers don&rsquo;t take measures to boost hiring numbers, we will see a shortfall of 240,000 drivers by 2020, the ATA said.<\/p>\n\n<p>Read our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/truckload-capacity-in-2014-a-grim-reality\">blog about truckload capacity <\/a>to learn more.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What impact will this have on my supply chain?<\/h2>\n\n<p>So, here comes the bad news for shippers. Since carriers are upping their labor costs, they need to still protect their profit margin. In order to do this, they must raise their bottom lines - in turn, raising their rates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Until the driver shortage flames have been put out, expect capacity to be tight and rates to be high.&nbsp; There are still not enough drivers to cover the volume of loads needing to be shipped. Carriers are forced to turn down loads because of not having trucks available, and if they&rsquo;re not turning them down because of capacity, they are hanging up because the rates offered are just too low.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How can I avoid the higher costs?<\/h2>\n\n<p>As long as you&rsquo;re shipping truckload, rising rates are something you&rsquo;re just going to have to factor into your budget. You will not be able to continue shipping at the same rates you locked in one year ago. This is the unpleasant truth.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, there is an alternative.<\/p>\n\n<p>If paying higher rates for truckload shipping is simply not an option, consider moving freight over the rail (intermodal).&nbsp; Not only is intermodal usually cheaper than truckload, it&rsquo;s environmentally friendly and can meet many of the requirements demanded in the truckload industry, like transporting reefer shipments in temperature controlled cars. However, its most appealing characteristic is the fact that it can offer plenty of capacity when trucks are hard to find for a reasonable price.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Just this year, intermodal volume for all of North America increased 5.7% to 13 million trailers and containers, according to the Association of American Railroads. Intermodal freight shipping is on the rise, and shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be your last option, because it&rsquo;s easily becoming your best. Even if you only utilize intermodal shipping a few times a year, it could save you time, money, and stress.<\/p>\n\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/five-reasons-you-should-be-shipping-intermodal\">blog about intermodal shipping<\/a> to learn more.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Sources:<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.truckinginfo.com\/channel\/drivers\/news\/story\/2014\/10\/ata-economic-panel-points-to-improvement-in-economy-while-driver-shortage-continues.aspx\">\"ATA MC&amp;E: Economy Improves, Driver Shortage Continues\", Truckinginfo <\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.truckline.com\/article.aspx?uid=33bc3361-8fef-4c73-bd38-98da53ef4d2a\">\"Turnover at For-Hire Carriers Largely Unchanged During the First Quarter\", ATA<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2014-09-25\/drivers-gain-from-wage-race-as-truckers-turn-away-cargo.html\">\"Drivers Gain From Wage Race as Truckers Turn Away Cargo\", Bloomberg<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/10\/02\/us-usa-trucks-driver-shortage-idUSKCN0HR2KK20141002\">\"Expanding U.S. economy exposes rising truck driver shortage\", Reuters<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<div id=\"slidebox\"><a class=\"close\">&nbsp;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/form-the-carrier-capacity-crunch?utm_source=SlideInCTA&amp;utm_medium=TruckersWagesBlog&amp;utm_campaign=CTA\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}carriercapacity-slidein.jpg\" style=\"width: 90%; height: auto; border: none;\" \/><\/a><\/div>"}, {"ID":"509","cat_name":null,"title":"Now Might Be the Time to Consider Just in Time Delivery","url_title":"now-might-be-the-time-to-consider-just-in-time-delivery","entry_date":"1415376060","exerpt":"Having a ton of unused inventory can really take a chunk out of your warehousing space and your budget. The Just in Time (JIT) supply chain model can be a viable solution to these problems. Here's how JIT can streamline your inbound and outbound logistics to match your manufacturing pace and cut your storage costs. ","content":"<p>Do you find yourself with little space for inventory? Is a large chunk of your money tied up in stocking materials that aren&rsquo;t needed yet? The just in time (JIT) supply chain model might be the best solution for your space and budget.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How does a JIT program work?<\/h2>\n\n<p>JIT is utilized as a means to protect profit and warehouse space in all types of industries, but especially in manufacturing and food production. This strategy can be used for the inbound delivery of raw materials, the outbound shipping of finished products, or both. The ultimate goal is to save money on inventory and storage costs by cutting (or completely eliminating) the amount that&rsquo;s sitting on shelves or in the warehouse. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This model allows for goods or materials to only be delivered when they&rsquo;re needed immediately, or &ldquo;just in time&rdquo;. While this makes for a constant drop-off and pick-up of products and materials, it lessens the amount of money and space invested in raw materials before they are needed in the manufacturing process, which frees up funds that might be needed elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why would a company choose JIT?<\/h2>\n\n<p>JIT became popular in the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s, most notably in the car manufacturing industry. This allowed for vehicles to be made and put together piece by piece, without taking up huge amounts of space and money on parts that weren&rsquo;t ready to be installed yet.<\/p>\n\n<p>Toyota still works primarily off of this business and logistics model, but JIT can work especially well for smaller companies too. Those with limited space and funds between each stage of manufacturing, as well as those with large gaps of time between production and delivery, may want to consider switching to the JIT model. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>If your business requires high value products to be stored, like metal, JIT might be a good fit. Since large amounts of inventory aren&rsquo;t kept on hand, there is less time between manufacturing and shipping for products to be lost, damaged, or stolen.<\/p>\n<p id=\"last\">\n\n<p>Businesses with perishable goods should also look into converting to JIT. It&rsquo;s important to keep expiration dates in mind when ordering products with a shelf life, and having them delivered only when and in the quantity needed, reduces waste and protects your bottom line.<\/p>\n\n<p>The great thing about JIT is that it can be adjusted for times when business is either booming or slowing. Companies that see slow seasons could especially benefit, as the logistics &rdquo;spigot&rdquo; can be turned down (or off completely) and you won&rsquo;t be left with a wasted surplus. Essentially, if parts or stock aren&rsquo;t needed, they don&rsquo;t have to be ordered or delivered.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How can Trinity help me switch to JIT?<\/h2>\n\n<p>As a full-service 3rd party logistics provider (3PL), Trinity can assist with all stages of the transition into the JIT program.

This is having an effect on both intermodal and truckload shipping. Here\u2019s the lowdown on the problem and how it could affect you. ","content":"<p>You may have heard on the news recently that West Coast ports have been clogged, delaying the importation of international goods.&nbsp; This is having an effect on both intermodal and truckload shipping. Here&rsquo;s the lowdown on the problem and how it could affect you.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>What&rsquo;s going on?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>West Coast ports, particularly those in California, have experienced slowdowns and delays on their docks. Ships are lining up at sea, waiting their turn to get in, as it&rsquo;s taking longer to unload the cargo of each ship while it is in port.<\/p>\n\n<p>Longshoremen (those who load and unload ships) are purposely taking their time with each ship, which forces the draymen (truck drivers who transport the cargo from the port to the rail) to sit idle. The draymen are getting paid less due to the longshoremen&rsquo;s slowdown, which has led to them picketing at the ports. Dockworkers are walking out mid-shift in retaliation.<\/p>\n\n<p>The culmination of all this: major port congestion that is crippling productivity and movement of goods across the U.S. You&rsquo;re probably wondering why on earth this is happening.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>What&rsquo;s the cause?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Longshoremen are on strike due to the lack of salary negotiation on their contracts and refusal of the ports to recognize them as employees, not contractors.<\/p>\n\n<p>This all started back on June 30th, when the last contract expired between the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), which represents employers operating shipping lines and port terminals, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU). The two parties have yet to negotiate the next contract for the dockworkers, which would recognize workers as employees in order to receive certain benefits.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the past five months, scrutinizing accusations have been thrown between the ILWU and the PMA. The ILWU claims that the PMA is refusing to negotiate the contracts and blaming its members for the port jamming in its entirety. In return, the PMA is accusing the ILWU of deliberately coaching its members to halt dock operations by conducting over-exaggerated inspections and working as slowly as possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>The truth is that the ILWU <em>is <\/em>coordinating work slowdowns and additional inspections, which have caused productivity to plummet. So far, the ports that have been affected are The Southern California Region, Port of Seattle, Port of Tacoma, Yusen Terminal, Long Beach Container Terminal, APM Terminal, Seaside Transportation Services, and Total Terminals International.<\/p>\n\n<p>Aside from all of the contract negotiation and labor issues going on, there were already problems affecting the ports prior to this. These include a higher volume of mega-ships (more cargo and longer wait times), chassis shortages, shortage of dray carriers, and a higher volume of shipments.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>What&#39;s the prognosis?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Recently, the National Retail Federation wrote a letter to President Obama, citing concern of a looming port shut-down if there was not intervention by a federal regulator to negotiate the dockworkers&rsquo; contracts. Obama responded by saying that the PMA and ILWU will work it out themselves in due time.<\/p>\n\n<p>With that being said, no contracts have been negotiated yet. This could mean continued and worsened port delays and backups. The more that the ILWU backs the longshoremen&rsquo;s strike, the more the draymen and drivers will picket, which increases the likelihood of an eventual port shutdown. This could create a domino effect, affecting imports on the East Coast as well.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>What impact will this have on you?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>In response to the congestion that is now affecting many of the West Coast ports, carriers are now tacking on surcharges to make up for the loss of profit due to the increasing time it takes to move and be unloaded. This could mean higher costs to get your shipment onto the rail, plus longer transit times overall.<\/p>\n\n<p>Luckily, the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) has been keeping a close eye on these shipping surcharges. Shipments that are already in-transit, or waiting to be unloaded, are not eligible to be assessed fees.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even though the turmoil between workers, unions, and the PMA seems to be unrelenting, there are still options for getting your goods from the West Coast and distributed throughout the country. Trinity offers intermodal, truckload, and LTL services. You may need to rely on a different mode of transportation than you normally do. Depending on the lane, some of these modes may be temporarily more expensive or take longer than they usually would. We can be your trusted resource in determining the most cost-effective and logical way to move your freight during this turbulent time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rest assured that Trinity is staying informed on the port congestion issue as it unfolds, and our sales representatives will be able to provide you with the best avenue to keep your freight moving.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.producenews.com\/news-dep-menu\/test-featured\/14572-labor-strife-threatens-west-coast-ports\"><strong>\"<\/strong><strong>Labor strife threatens West Coast ports\", The Produce News<\/strong><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.joc.com\/maritime-news\/labor\/dozens-vessels-heading-west-coast-ports-face-dock-congestion_20141115.html\"><strong>\"<\/strong><strong>Dozens of vessels heading to US West Coast ports face dock congestion\", JOC<\/strong><\/a><br \/>\n<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/seattletimes.com\/html\/businesstechnology\/2025027427_portslowdownfeesxml.html\">\"Shipping companies announce container surcharge at ports\", The Seattle Times<\/a><\/strong><\/p>"}, {"ID":"512","cat_name":"Truckload","title":"New Tanker Endorsement Regulations: Are You Driving Illegally?","url_title":"new-tanker-endorsement-regulations-are-you-driving-illegally","entry_date":"1417729260","exerpt":"There has been some buzz in the trucking industry over the past few years about a new regulation regarding tanker endorsements for CDL holders.

The information that has been published about this online is fairly vague, so we&rsquo;d like to set some facts straight to help you ensure that you&rsquo;re hauling your liquid or gaseous freight legally.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Do I need a tanker endorsement?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has rolled out a new regulation meant to keep the roads safe from commercial drivers carrying large amounts of liquid or gaseous freight without the proper training. In order to do this, the FMCSA changed the definition of a &ldquo;tanker,&rdquo; which, in turn, has changed the requirements for which drivers are required to hold a &ldquo;tanker endorsement&rdquo; on their CDL. &nbsp;This change means that even those who are driving dry vans, reefers, flatbeds, and box trucks will be required to hold the endorsement if they meet the requirements below. If the following conditions occur, you are responsible for obtaining a tanker endorsement on your CDL:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Your cargo includes liquid or gaseous individual containers larger than 119 gallon capacity.<\/li>\n\t<li>The containers are loaded, and not empty.<\/li>\n\t<li>The total combined volume in those containers exceeds 1,000 gallons.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<h2><strong>Where is it being enforced?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>All states will begin enforcing this regulation in July 2015, but some states are already enforcing the new rule. This has become an issue for carriers who are unaware of the differing regulations across state borders.<\/p>\n\n<p>States that are <strong><em>not<\/em><\/strong> known to be currently enforcing the regulation are: NM, CA, AK, KS, NE, SD, IA, IL, OH, NC, NH, and FL.<\/p>\n\n<p>States that are <em><strong>softly<\/strong> <\/em>enforcing the regulation are: ID, MO, and VA.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><em>All<\/em> <\/strong>other states are <em><strong>fully<\/strong> <\/em>enforcing the regulation as of now.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>When will it become law?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>The tanker endorsement regulation was originally debuted by the FMCSA in 2011 and it was said then that all states must be in line and enforcing by July 2014. Since that date has passed and not all states are on board, this has caused quite the confusion for national carriers. The FMSCA has now pushed a hard deadline of July 2015.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>What are the consequences of not abiding by the law?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>If commercial drivers are found to be driving without the proper tanker endorsement (if their load meets the regulation requirements) they can be charged a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per instance, as well as possible license suspension for up to 90 days, according to the FMCSA Section 383.53.<\/p>\n\n<p>In other words, this regulation should not be taken lightly. If you don&rsquo;t follow the law, your job could be on the line.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>Why haven&rsquo;t I heard about it?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>This law may come as a surprise to many, as there hasn&rsquo;t been much media coverage since its unveiling in May of 2011. The reason why there hasn&rsquo;t been much talk is likely because there was a three year delay from its creation to the original enforcement date of July 2014. Years have gone by with some states taking the regulation into consideration, and others ignoring it, as they were not legally required to enforce it.<\/p>\n\n<p>You will most likely be hearing more about it as all states adhere to the law and drivers start facing penalties.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>How do I get the endorsement?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>To get the endorsement, simply go to your state&rsquo;s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and request the Tanker Endorsement Knowledge Test and pay the fees, which average around twenty dollars. There are a few practice tests available online, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.truckingtruth.com\/cdl-test\/cdl-test-tanker-endorsement-A.html\">this one<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even though this won&rsquo;t be enforced nationwide until July 2015, the smart move is to go ahead and get the tanker endorsement on your license as soon as possible if you plan on carrying any significant volume of liquid and gaseous material, hazardous or not. The process of getting the endorsement is extremely minimal compared to the consequences of being caught without it.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Note: The information provided in this article is up-to-date at the time of publishing.

","content":"<p>Passing with a huge federal government budget bill on December 16th, some fine print included in the legislation &ndash; called the Collins Amendment &ndash; has suspended a portion of the highly-debated hours of service (HOS) restart rules that went into effect in July 2013.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>What did the HOS restart regulations entail?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The HOS restart regulations require truck drivers to take a 34-hour consecutive break at the end of their week in order to &ldquo;restart&rdquo; their hours for the week. Two 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. periods must be included within that 34-hour period of rest. A driver may not &ldquo;restart&rdquo; their week until these requirements have been met.<\/p>\n\n<p>This new regulation was met with harsh criticism from truckers and shippers alike. Because of the 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. periods included in the restart, truckers were forced to end their work week between 7 p.m. and 1 a.m. in order to take advantage of the 34 hour restart. This is poor timing in the trucking world, but if a driver were to end their week before 7 p.m. or after 1 a.m., this adds extra hours of wait time to hit the two 1 a.m.&ndash; 5 a.m. periods required for them to restart their hours.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is the Collins Amendment?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Named after the Senator who sponsored it, the Collins Amendment suspends a portion of the HOS regulations until September 30, which is the end of the 2015 fiscal year. This amendment still requires the 34-hour restart period, but eliminates the required 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. &nbsp;rest periods, so the restart period can be taken at any time.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that this amendment only applies until September. After that, it could be overturned. It is hoped that, by then, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) will have finished its study of the safety impacts of having the original legislation in place, and a decision will be made accordingly.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is the reaction?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The American Trucking Associations (ATA), Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), and Truckload Carriers Association (TCA) have all backed the suspension and are thanking lawmakers who made it happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>These trucking associations have made it clear that they think the federal government did not do enough research or evaluation of actual truck drivers to get a real glimpse of where more regulations were needed. They feel micromanaged with the restrictions and don&rsquo;t think it helps safety, especially with drivers starting their new weeks during morning rush hour traffic to make up for the nights they spent off the road.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What does this mean for truck drivers?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Until next fall, truckers can take their 34-hour restart breaks as they wish, at the times that suit them best. Truck drivers who use an electronic hour log should double check that their employer has updated the program to reflect the suspension of the regulations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Moving forward, things may change based upon the FMCSA&rsquo;s safety study. If it is found that the regulations led to less accidents involving trucks, it may be reinstated. This could mean tighter driving restrictions and inconvenient off-the-road hours.<\/p>\n\n<p>Shippers should also keep an eye on the HOS regulations as they unfold. If this bill is overturned, it could mean tighter pick-up and delivery windows and leaner carrier capacity.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}truck_clock.jpg\" style=\"height:248px; width:500px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>Sources:&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.joc.com\/regulation-policy\/transportation-regulations\/congress-includes-trucker-hos-suspension-cromnibus-spending-bill_20141210.html\">Congress Includes Trucker HOS Suspension in &#39;Cromnibus&#39; Spending Bill, JOC.com<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/fleetowner.com\/regulations\/battle-brews-over-hos-restart-rider-budget-bill\">Battle Brews Over HOS \"Restart Rider\" in Budget Bill, FleetOwner<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ttnews.com\/articles\/basetemplate.aspx?storyid=36892&amp;page=1\">Reversing HOS Restart Restrictions,&nbsp;Transport Topics<\/a><\/strong><\/p>"}, {"ID":"522","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Our Top 10 Most Popular Blog Posts in 2014","url_title":"our-top-10-most-popular-blog-posts-in-2014","entry_date":"1420032960","exerpt":"In case you didn\u2019t catch them the first time around, here\u2019s a list of our top ten most-read blog posts in 2014.","content":"<p>In case you didn&rsquo;t catch them the first time around, here&rsquo;s a list of our top ten most-read blog posts in 2014.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-three\">&#8203;1. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/top-10-factors-to-consider\">Top 10 Factors to Consider When Selecting a Warehouse: Part One<\/a><\/h2>\n\n<p>This blog post also topped the list in 2013.

We\u2019ve put together ten useful tips to help you get your loads delivered safely this winter. ","content":"<p>As winter weather sets in for most of the country, you should take precautions to keep not only you and your truck safe, but also others on the road. We&rsquo;ve put together ten useful tips to help you get your loads delivered safely this winter.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Monitor the weather<\/h2>\n\n<p>This one might seem really obvious, but knowing ahead of time that a storm is brewing is key to staying safe.&nbsp; If a blizzard or wintery mix is predicted in your area, you can set into motion your plan of action for pickups and drop offs. Since weather predictions ahead of time can be faulty, don&rsquo;t forget to stay tuned to the radio, radar maps, or the Weather Channel for information on real-time road conditions.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>2. Plan your trip<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Before getting on the road, take the time to plan and map out your route according to the weather. Take into consideration that some roads may be closed or too rough to navigate. If possible, plan the times you will be going over overpasses to be after the snow has melted, or at least, plowed. Calculate your driving speed for heavy snow weather to be about 25 mph and plan safe parking places and pick-up and delivery times accordingly. This way, you won&rsquo;t be facing possible issues with your Hours of Service (HOS) before making it to a safe resting stop. Make sure to have a few alternate safe stops planned, just in case conditions get too bad in other places.<\/p>\n\n<h2>3. Check equipment pre-trip and mid-trip<\/h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s always vital to check your equipment before you hit the road, but especially so when winter weather strikes. Check that all lights are working properly, air is drained from the truck&rsquo;s and trailer&rsquo;s tanks to avoid frozen brake lines, and tire pressures to prevent a disastrous flat.<\/p>\n\n<p>After hitting rough patches of snow or ice, make sure to make a safe stop to knock off tire flaps and undercarriages. This could prevent damage to your rig, but also other vehicles when the packed ice eventually comes off.<\/p>\n\n<h2><strong>4. Have extra equipment on board<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Be prepared for the iciest conditions by having some of the best snow gear on board. You should make sure to have:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>chains (the right size)<\/li>\n\t<li>bungees<\/li>\n\t<li>waterproof gloves<\/li>\n\t<li>reflective vest<\/li>\n\t<li>flashlight<\/li>\n\t<li>kneeling pad<\/li>\n\t<li>boots with good traction<\/li>\n\t<li>warm clothing<\/li>\n\t<li>extra washer fluid<\/li>\n\t<li>anti-gel<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>5. Maintain as much space as possible<\/h2>\n\n<p>One of the most common factors in winter accidents is following too closely behind other vehicles. You may not be able to control the cars behind you, but you can do your best to make sure there is enough cushion space between you and the car ahead of you. This leaves you with options if your brakes aren&rsquo;t working as quickly as they should.<\/p>\n\n<h2>6. Slow down<\/h2>\n\n<p>Put the posted speed limits into context. If roads are covered in snow or ice, it might not be safe or feasible to maintain that 50 mph speed limit. Going faster leaves more room for error with stopping the truck and trailer, as well as reduces your reaction time. Slow down and only go as fast as you are reasonably able to. Keep to the right and let other vehicles pass you if they want - don&rsquo;t feel pressured to speed up if they are following too close behind. You are driving with everyone&rsquo;s safety in mind when you go easy on the pedal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>7. Know what to do if you lose traction<\/h2>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s no fool-proof method for not losing traction in bad weather. It&rsquo;s important that you know what to do if it happens, since this lessens the severity of any possible accidents. The number one thing to remember: never use the clutch or engine brake when traction is lost, as this could make the situation worse. Just gently let your foot off the pedal and steer in the direction that the back end of the vehicle is going, which should allow you to then gain back control.<\/p>\n\n<h2>8. Be careful getting in and out of the truck<\/h2>\n\n<p>Again, this might seem obvious, but just remember that steps will most likely be slippery. It&rsquo;s not unheard of for a driver to fall and seriously injure themselves by underestimating the condition of truck steps. Make sure to wear boots with good grip and take your time going up and down. Also, always keep in mind your surroundings. Take extra caution getting in and out of the tractor on roads with low visibility. Always wear an orange safety vest.<\/p>\n\n<h2>9. Hold your steeling wheel firmly and with confidence<\/h2>\n\n<p>Winter weather is not the time to be reaching for a snack or answering a text. Always keep your hands firmly on the wheel in case you hit a rough patch of snow, or need to react quickly to unforeseen conditions on the road. At the same time, be confident in your driving skills. Try to remain calm and avoid sporadic driving.<\/p>\n\n<h2>10. Know your and your vehicle&rsquo;s limitations<\/h2>\n\n<p>There may come a point in which the weather simply makes the roads too unsafe to travel. Don&rsquo;t push your luck if conditions are bad &ndash; yours and others&rsquo; lives are at the top of the priority list.&nbsp; Take this time to make a safe stop and wait the storm out. Catch up on some rest to get back on the road as soon as possible.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"524","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"West Coast Port Congestion Update: Federal Mediator to Battle the Stalemate","url_title":"west-coast-port-congestion-update-federal-mediator-to-battle-the-stalemate","entry_date":"1421426460","exerpt":"Back in November, we filled you in on the port congestion happening on the West Coast due to disputes between dockworkers and their management.

We&rsquo;d like to give a quick update on the situation as we move into 2015.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-two\">What&rsquo;s changed since November?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The short answer: not much has changed, in terms of the slowdowns. Longshoremen are still halting productivity and employers are still not budging on their contract conditions. However, measures have recently been taken to improve the situation.<\/p>\n\n<p>At first, President Obama said that the federal government would stay out of the argument and let &ldquo;nature run its course.&rdquo; In other words, let the dockworkers and their employers come to their own terms in order to keep the ports running productively.<\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, an agreement still hasn&rsquo;t been made and it&rsquo;s been over six months since contracts for the dockworkers have run out. Ships are still lining up at sea to get unloaded at the ports, longshoremen are still stalling unloading trucks, the workers&rsquo; union is still accusing management of being the source of all the issues, and productivity has taken a major hit.<\/p>\n\n<p>This has prompted the federal government to finally get involved. A federal mediator has been employed to get each side to come to agreeable terms. This recent stride by the government won&rsquo;t necessarily end all of the chaos, but it could be a major step in the right direction.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What&rsquo;s next?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The federal mediator is there to address both sides of the issue and come up with a diplomatic approach that satisfies both sides of the fence. This could take some time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Employers are warning that if an agreement isn&rsquo;t made soon, the major ports at Long Beach and Los Angeles could be facing a gridlock. At this time, the only common grounds that have been established are regarding health care and pay guarantees. The main issues left unapproved are union jurisdiction, automation, pensions and salary.<\/p>\n\n<p>The silver lining to the big disagreement on the coast is that imports are still expected to rise this year, according to the National Retail Federation. The data shows that import volumes on the West Coast were the highest since 2009, despite all of the issues and conflicts on the docks. January&rsquo;s imports are expected to be up 1.1 percent from January 2014.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is good news for the economy, even if there are hurdles to getting the freight shipped across the USA once it arrives at the port.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-two\">What does this mean for my supply chain?<\/h2>\n\n<p>This means that your shipments coming into West Coast ports will likely still be delayed until a solution has been agreed upon, but keep in mind that imports are not being completely halted. Ships are still coming in, just at a slower pace.<\/p>\n\n<p>Trinity is still keeping up to date on these matters to ensure that we are offering the most competitive shipping rates and timelines.

","content":"<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) recently announced it will allow Mexican carriers to apply for permission to conduct long-haul, cross-border trucking services in the United States.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, Mexican drivers are not permitted to haul freight across the U.S. border. Shipments coming from Mexico are transloaded at the border, and an American truck driver hauls the freight to its final destination in the U.S. Now, with approval, Mexican carriers will be able to haul the freight all the way from Mexico to its American destination.<\/p>\n\n<p>It is the federal government&rsquo;s hope that this change will expand international trading opportunities for the nation and eliminate more than $2 billion in annual retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Initial Pilot Program<\/h2>\n\n<p>In order to test out this cross-border idea, the federal government rolled out a three-year pilot program for Mexican carriers, which concluded in October 2014.<\/p>\n\n<p>The FMCSA reported that fifteen Mexican trucking companies enrolled in the pilot program. These carriers crossed the border more than 28,000 times and drove more than 1.5 million miles in the United States. During this time, more than 5,500 safety inspections were conducted by American officials.<\/p>\n\n<p>The DOT concluded from the pilot program that Mexican carriers are able to comply with safety regulations just as well as carriers from the U.S. and Canada; therefore, the government could safely move forward with the cross-border carrier program.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Elimination of Retaliatory Tariffs<\/h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. is hoping to eliminate the retaliatory tariffs on trades with Mexico that arose due to a 2009 U.S. appropriations bill that sabotaged any chance at opening the American border to Mexican truck drivers. Since the cross-border pilot program&rsquo;s debut in 2011, the Mexican government has suspended the tariffs. With the new cross-border program being instated, this could eliminate the tariffs altogether, which total over $2 billion annually.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Beginning<\/h2>\n\n<p>As of January 15, the FMCSA has officially begun accepting applications for Mexican truck drivers to have the authority to operate their trucks on long-hauls across the Mexican-American border. This means that drivers without American licenses will be able to haul goods into the nation.<\/p>\n\n<p>This new international driver program has received some heavy criticism from U.S. Representatives. Some, including Rep. DeFazio of Oregon, plan to use their legislative authority to put pressure on the FMCSA to take into consideration some problems that the open-border may cause. DeFazio claimed that the pilot cross-border program did not have enough participants to make a safe and fair decision.<\/p>\n\n<p>For some, this also leads to concern about criminal activity. This program might seem to provide a golden opportunity for transporting illegal drugs across the border. However, the DOT has declared that their safety checks and regulations will prevent the crimes.<\/p>\n\n<p>For supporters, especially U.S. agriculture shippers, this is an opportunity to lessen the truck driver shortage. Essentially, opening the borders to Mexican carriers will add drivers and truckload capacity for Americans as well.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Impact&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>With the U.S. facing a driver shortage estimated around 30,000, a new pool of drivers might not be such a bad idea. The DOT assures that Mexican drivers will not be taking American jobs; rather, they will be helping to fill the empty truck cabs that are unable to take on these long-haul moves. In turn, this frees up American carriers for in-state lanes.<\/p>\n\n<p>This will also result in less handling of freight while it crosses the border, as a transload will no longer be required.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, trade by value shipped across the border rose 9.6 percent year over year to $34 billion in October. If the retaliatory tariffs are eliminated, this program could result in a major return for Americans and the U.S. economy.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Sources:<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.joc.com\/regulation-policy\/transportation-regulations\/us-transportation-regulations\/us-ag-shippers-applaud-truck-border-crossing-decision_20150119.html\">US Ag Shippers Applaud Truck Border-crossing Decision, <em>JOC<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.overdriveonline.com\/fmcsa-officially-opens-authority-application-process-for-mexican-carriers\/?utm_content=buffer24885&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">FMCSA Officially Opens Authority Application Process for Mexican Carriers, <em>Overdrive<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.overdriveonline.com\/could-cross-border-expansion-bring-more-loads-for-u-s-carriers-also-congress-may-act-on-fmcsas-border-move\/\">Congress May Use Highway Bill to Challenge FMCSA&rsquo;s Cross-border Expansion, <em>Overdrive<\/em><\/a><\/p>"}, {"ID":"528","cat_name":"Truckload","title":"Women in Trucking: A Story of Perseverance","url_title":"women-in-trucking-a-story-of-perseverance","entry_date":"1422990180","exerpt":"Over the past year, women have been the talk of the trucking industry.

The numbers of female truck drivers are on the rise, and the challenges that come along with being a woman in the industry are becoming better known. We spoke to some women in trucking to get a clearer picture of the current situation.<\/p>\n\n<h2>More women behind the wheel<\/h2>\n\n<p>Some say it&rsquo;s because of the national driver shortage, and others say it&rsquo;s because of rising wages, but the fact remains that there are more women in the driver&rsquo;s seats of big rigs now than ever before.<\/p>\n\n<p>In fact, the percentage of women in trucking (versus men) has more than doubled since 1990. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, women made up only about 2.1 percent of truckers in 1990, but in 2012, they were up to about 5.4 percent. These numbers may not seem drastic, but considering we&rsquo;re talking about thousands of truck drivers, that&rsquo;s pretty significant.<\/p>\n\n<p>Even events outside of commercial driving, like the National Truck Driving Competition in Pittsburgh, have seen an increase in female truck drivers. Their most recent competition event in August 2014 had 11 female participants, which is more than they&rsquo;ve seen in over 77 years of hosting the event.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some women are attracted to the truck driving industry because of the salary, but others are motivated by personal struggles.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was recently divorced with a young daughter and needed to get back into the workforce fulltime with a good income to provide a good life for my daughter,&rdquo; said Joanne Fatta, a 15-year trucking veteran.<\/p>\n\n<p>Fatta was able to use state funding to go to driving school and has been with the same company since graduating over a decade ago.&nbsp; She was the only female driver at her company for many years.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As truck drivers, we also unload trailers, which is very physically demanding. I stuck it out through many work-related injuries and was awarded driver of the year for 2013, which is a huge honor at my company,&rdquo; Fatta said.<\/p>\n\n<p>For other women, the reaction from the public is motivation to keep them in the driver&rsquo;s seat.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Honestly, I love the looks and reactions I get from other drivers and customers,&rdquo; said Monica Horne, a trucker in her fourth year of driving, &ldquo;men look at me in almost disbelief or amazement.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>The unique traveling opportunities are also a perk for female CDL holders.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I always tell people that I&rsquo;m a paid tourist, as I&rsquo;ve seen some gorgeous places,&rdquo; Horne said.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I keep a journal of our travels and share with friends, and I have even self-published four volumes,&rdquo; said Chris Miller, a truck driver for seven years. &ldquo;My husband and I do the lower 48 states and Canada.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Facing unique challenges<\/h2>\n\n<p>Although more women are making their way into the trucking industry, they sometimes face challenges that may hinder their overall success - or halt them completely.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sexual harassment is one of the biggest issues that women, in particular, are facing in the trucking industry. While this can happen on the road or during training, sexual harassment also comes in more forms than you might think. According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a blanket term that refers to any situation where a person is harassed or discriminated against because of their gender.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some women are encountering these discriminations in the CDL training process. In a recent federal court case, a judge ruled that New Prime, Inc., which is one of the nation&rsquo;s largest trucking companies, violated a federal law by requiring that female truck driver applicants be trained only by female trainers. This was hindering the number of female students graduating the course because there were only a few female trainers available for students. This was ruled as sexual harassment and discrimination by the federal courts.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still like the 1950&rsquo;s out here,&rdquo; remarked Desiree Wood, President of REAL Women in Trucking, referring to classic gender roles in the transportation industry. According to Wood, women are having a hard time being seen as equals behind the wheel of a truck.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Simply put, women are invisible in this industry,&rdquo; said Wood, &ldquo;they need support.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Support Groups<\/h2>\n\n<p>Some individuals have seen a need to offer support services for both current and prospective female drivers. Those with experience in the trucking industry, like Wood, have seen the struggles women go through to get their Commercial Driver&rsquo;s License, let alone actually getting a job as a paid driver.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Only one in six women who attempt to get their CDL actually makes it,&rdquo; Wood said.<\/p>\n\n<p>She feels that many of these women fall through the cracks of the system and are kicked out for unfair reasons, like not passing dock loading tests due to lack of one-on-one training time. This is one of the main reasons she offers a free membership for female trucking students to her grassroots association, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.realwomenintrucking.com\">REAL Women in Trucking<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>REAL Women in Trucking offers information for students about CDL testing and the trucking industry, as well as advice from experienced female CDL holders. For those with six months or less of truck driving experience, Wood offers virtual mentorship with follow-up phone calls through each step of the training and testing process, as well as an emergency crisis phone line.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The numbers of women in the trucking industry are going up, but they could be even higher if women got the support they need to make it through CDL training as well as their first year of commercial driving,&rdquo; Wood said.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information on REAL Women in Trucking, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.realwomenintrucking.com\">www.realwomenintrucking.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Sources:<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www1.eeoc.gov\/eeoc\/newsroom\/release\/8-18-14a.cfm?renderforprint=1\">Federal Judge Rules Prime Trucking&rsquo;s Same-Sex Training Policy Violates Federal Law,&nbsp;<em>U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pittsburgh.cbslocal.com\/2014\/08\/15\/more-women-showing-off-skills-at-national-truck-driving-championships\/\">More Women Showing Off Skills At National Truck Driving&nbsp;Championships, <em>CBS Pittsburgh<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/cps\/home.htm\">Current Population Survey 1983-2002 and 2000-2012, <em>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/em><\/a><\/p>"}, {"ID":"531","cat_name":"Intermodal","title":"Top 4 Intermodal Shipping Myths: Busted","url_title":"top-4-intermodal-shipping-myths-busted","entry_date":"1424100540","exerpt":"There seem to be a lot of misconceptions about intermodal shipping, especially compared to other modes of transportation.

Shipping over the rail is definitely worth your consideration, so we&rsquo;re going to set the record straight on some of these intermodal myths. Have you discounted the idea of intermodal shipping because of one of these misunderstandings?<\/p>\n\n<h2>1.&ldquo;Shipping via rail is slow.&rdquo;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Because rail shipping has been around for a long time, it was, as you can imagine, quite a slow method of transport many decades ago. However, it&rsquo;s a very different story now. The fact is: yes, moving freight via rail is usually slower than moving it over the road, but probably not as dramatically as you think.<\/p>\n\n<p>Most lanes are only about one day behind truckload shipping. Sometimes, loads that must be interlined between railroads can take a bit longer. However, for most customers that utilize rail shipments, the extra day or two of transit time is a small price to pay for such large cost savings in comparison to other modes of transportation.<\/p>\n\n<h2>2.&ldquo;Intermodal shipping is unreliable.&rdquo;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Before technology and infrastructure developments, the rail was deemed too unreliable, with unpredictable transit times and delivery dates. These days, that couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. In fact, countless major retailers utilize the rail to move their shipments across the country, depending on its reliability. Most intermodal lanes are in the high-90th percentile for on-time delivery.<\/p>\n\n<h2>3.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a much higher chance of damage and loss with intermodal.&rdquo;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Some may claim that shipping intermodal increases the chances of damaged freight due to the combination of truck and rail services. The bottom line is that this isn&rsquo;t true. As long as the freight is blocked and braced properly, the train is in for a smooth ride; in fact, in a study done by the Association of American Railroads, they found that the ride quality environment on the railroad is similar to the ride quality on the highway. There&rsquo;s also a lower risk of damage due to accidents and weather.<\/p>\n\n<p>Others seem to think that chances of loss are higher with intermodal shipping. Again, this is just an untruthful myth. In fact, chances of loss are significantly lowered, because once the container is loaded onto the train, it is locked up and on the move for almost the entirety of its trip. The freight is not vulnerable to be hijacked at a rest stop like it would be on a truck.<\/p>\n\n<h2>4.&ldquo;Tracking intermodal freight is difficult.&rdquo;<\/h2>\n\n<p>When you ship over the rail, there&rsquo;s truly no need to wonder or stress about when your freight has been picked up and delivered or where it&rsquo;s at in between. It doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;vanish&rdquo; once the train pulls away from the rail yard. Many intermodal containers are equipped with tracking devices that allow your logistics provider or rail carrier to provide you with real-time updates on the location of your freight. When you ship intermodal with Trinity, we are in constant contact with the rail provider to ensure we have up-to-date information on the location of your freight.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just like swallowed chewing gum doesn&rsquo;t take seven years to digest, intermodal shipping is not a mode of transportation you should avoid due to inaccurate myths.

For those who have not implemented transportation management software (TMS), this is usually done with paper and pencil or an Excel spreadsheet.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Many factors go into optimizing shipments, including the number of pallets and weight of each shipment (taking trailer size into consideration), delivery availability for locations, and special services needed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Perhaps one of the most important dynamics of building a shipment is delivery deadlines. It&rsquo;s imperative to take note of whether a truck can deliver to single or multiple locations and arrive on time, factoring in the drivers&rsquo; hours of service (HOS) and loading and unloading times.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Essentially, it&rsquo;s a like a jig-saw puzzle made up of your freight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>How can a freight optimizer help me?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The optimizer tool in a TMS will take your list of open shipments and consolidate them into loads based on the criteria specified by you. The software&rsquo;s criteria encompasses ship and delivery date flexibility, maximum weight per shipment, maximum number of pieces, number of picks and drops, driver hours, and more.<\/p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re also able to choose which carriers you want to include for consideration. Once these parameters are set and the optimizer has been run, you also have the capability to auto-create loads in the TMS based on the optimizer&rsquo;s results.<\/p>\n\n<p>The optimizer tool accomplishes in minutes what usually takes a person hours to calculate and configure, with the likelihood of saving money in the meantime. The top benefits here translate to both time and money saved.

Over the next year, you may need to prepare to say goodbye to LTL rates based on freight class. Dimensional pricing is the future, for better or worse, and we&rsquo;ve got all the details you need to know.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is dimensional pricing?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Historically, LTL carriers have priced their shipments based on freight class. The freight class of your shipment is determined by characteristics like density, value, ease of handling, and stowability. These freight classes have allowed for standardized, predictable pricing across LTL carriers. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This new form of pricing, however, means the cost of your LTL shipment is strictly based on its dimensions. To put it simply, pricing will be based entirely off the freight&rsquo;s height, length and width only.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why the change?<\/h2>\n\n<p>LTL carriers have realized that switching to dimensional pricing would generally allow for more shipments to be moved at a time, which would boost their profit.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to carriers, some customers are taking up a lot of valuable space on their trailers with relatively light and bulky shipments, essentially &ldquo;cubing them out&rdquo;. The trailers aren&rsquo;t anywhere near their weight limit, but there&rsquo;s no more room in the trailer to haul other shipments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some LTL carriers feel that it&rsquo;s easy for customers to work the system by &ldquo;misrepresenting&rdquo; their freight class in order to get a lower rate. Switching to dimensional pricing leaves little room for misrepresentation, as the dimensions of the freight are clearly measurable by the carrier. &nbsp;They also feel that dimensional pricing is fairer to the customer, as it will be more closely related to actual shipping costs for the carrier.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Is this guaranteed to happen?<\/h2>\n\n<p>There has been a significant amount of talk among LTL carriers about testing out the dimensional pricing method and looking into the scanning technology needed to easily calculate freight dimensions. This has been sparked by a switch to dimensional pricing in the parcel world. At the end of December 2014, UPS switched to dimensional for its ground services. FedEx Ground shifted to dimensional on packages three cubic feet or more in January 2015.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since such major parcel carriers have already made the switch, experts are agreeing it&rsquo;s a good indication that the LTL industry is soon to follow suit. In fact, UPS Freight, the LTL branch of UPS, has begun offering dimensional pricing as an alternate to class rates. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>What changes can I expect for my LTL shipping rates?<\/h2>\n\n<p>After the switch to dimensional pricing, you&rsquo;ll notice cheaper shipping costs for more dense freight, whereas those shipments that are light and take up more room could be more expensive than you&rsquo;re used to. For example, a large pallet containing boxes of ping pong balls would be much closer to shipping the same size pallet of bricks, while pricing based on freight class would mean two very different rates for those shipments.<\/p>\n\n<p>Just keep in mind that LTL carriers are looking to ship as much freight as possible in one trailer to meet their profit margin. If your freight takes up most of their space, the new pricing will reflect that. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The change may not have happened in the LTL industry yet, but it&rsquo;s definitely on the way. With that being said, Trinity will be here to update you on any progress in the matter.

We were surprised to see which states dominated the total incidents. We go over the hotspots and tips to avoid getting your freight stolen.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Study<\/h2>\n\n<p>The recent study released from IMUA used many sources including CargoNet and FreightWatch International, whose primary focuses are to track cargo theft cases throughout the U.S. The 28-page publication highlights each of the cargo theft incidents and groups them into categories of state and road stops.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The point of the two year investigation was to spotlight common theft occurrences and threads, so that shippers and carriers could make informed decisions about their routing and stops on their shipments.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Hotspots for Cargo Theft<\/h2>\n\n<p>According to the study, 298 cargo theft incidents were recorded between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014. It was made clear that five states had significantly higher occurrences above the other 40.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here are the top 5 hotspots and how the study recommends you avoid them on your route.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Texas<\/strong> had 52 incidents. Roads running east-west (I-10, 20, 30 and 40) were the most hit. It is advised that drivers avoid stopping in and around Dallas and Houston to avoid major thefts.<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\"><strong>2. Georgia <\/strong>had 49 incidents. Roads running north-south (I- 75, 85, 95 and 675), I-20 and specifically, at Exit 19, were clearly hotspots. To steer clear of this, trucks should choose exits up to 140 (except for 11) and not those further down the interstate.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\"><strong>3. Florida<\/strong> had 34 incidents. Roads running north-south (I-75, I-95 and I-295) were the most heavily hit, which is where major traffic flows. According to the study, this could be because the most prolific gangs operate from this state. Consider avoiding I-10 in either Lee and Midway and I-75 between Exits 329 and 368 and I-95, particularly near Ft. Pierce and St. Augustine. Truck stops along I-75 in Ft. Myers down the west coast are also active, so use caution there as well.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\"><strong>4.<\/strong> <strong>California<\/strong> had 23 incidents. Truck stops were the number one spot for cargo thefts in this state. Try to make stops distant from Barstow, Hesperia, Ludlow and the I-10 corridor between (east to west) Colton, Rialto and Fontana.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\"><strong>5.<\/strong> <strong>South Carolina<\/strong> had 16 incidents. The most traffic from truck seems to be north and south, though there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be many correlations between each incident. The IMUA recommends drivers to be cautious of stopping along I-85 between Exits 90, 104, and I-95 Exits 77, 164, 169 and 181<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2>Tips for Avoiding Cargo Thefts<\/h2>\n\n<p>The Cargo Theft Hotspot Study includes a list of tips for drivers to lessen their chances of getting freight stolen. We&rsquo;d like to highlight what we think are some of the best.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Make sure you have enough Hours of Service and fuel to travel at least 200 miles before stopping<span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li>Take your mandated short (30-minute) rest break either before leaving the shipment origin or after driving 200 miles.<\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Park so that the trailer doors are tight against a wall, pole or other immovable object, to avoid break-ins.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Only visit truck and rest stops that are well lighted and secure. When you stop, park along with fellow trucks and position them so that it is always visible to you.<\/span><\/li>\n\t<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Always carry identification of both the tractor and trailer with you. This information should contain relevant details such as make, model, year and vehicle license numbers.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Using these tips and theft statistics should help you make informed decisions about your routes to and from deliveries to ensure you and your freight&rsquo;s safety.

So, how do you keep transportation costs low without sacrificing reliability and service? And who do you use to achieve that? In this blog we lay out the facts to help you make the best decision.  ","content":"<p>There&rsquo;s no easy way to answer the question of whether to go with an asset-based or non-asset based provider for your intermodal needs, because it truly depends on what your business requires to keep components and products moving. Let&rsquo;s face it, transportation is critical, but it&rsquo;s not usually a profit center - it&rsquo;s an expense.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is all the more reason to pick an intermodal transportation company that can suit your needs and your budget.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, how do you keep transportation costs low without sacrificing reliability and service?&nbsp;&nbsp; And who do you use to achieve that?&nbsp; It might be an intermodal provider with their own fleet of containers (asset-based), or it might be a provider that depends on a network of carriers (non-asset based), or it may even be both.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Asset-Based Providers<\/h2>\n\n<p>There are approximately 237,000 domestic intermodal containers in the U.S. fleet currently, and asset-based providers control 157,000 of these.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>With asset-based providers, it&rsquo;s all about their network.&nbsp; They must work to keep their network fluid, which means maximizing equipment utilization as much as possible.&nbsp; Profit determines everything - your rates, and when you get equipment, if it&rsquo;s available. Shippers using asset-based companies often find themselves on their provider&rsquo;s schedule, not their own.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>While asset-based intermodal providers can sometimes offer competitive rates, this is not always the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are lucky enough to fit into their preferred network and can adjust to their schedules, choosing them may benefit your budget.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, or don&rsquo;t always, or just can&rsquo;t be in their network, the rate advantage will not be there.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, the needs of the network change. This can happen at any time, and when it does, you may need to adjust again - because it can affect your rates, available capacity, and loading schedules. Where you are geographically, how much business you do with a supplier, what the shipper down the street is doing - these all come into play when the asset-based provider needs to prioritize. Their customers end up crossing their fingers, hoping that they&rsquo;ll make the cut.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Non-Asset Based Providers<\/h2>\n\n<p>Non-asset based providers have access to the entire fleet of 237,000 domestic&nbsp; rail containers, huge pools of shared 20&rsquo;, 40&rsquo;, and 45&rsquo; containers available for domestic use, and are able to partner with all rail providers.&nbsp; To them, networks don&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; Non-asset providers only take one thing into consideration &ndash; their customer&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows them to create flexible and customized solutions for the customer, and if the customer&rsquo;s requirements change, the provider is able to adjust fairly quickly.<\/p>\n\n<p>Non-asset providers are able to find the most competitive pricing and available capacity by looking at all of the options, not just one.&nbsp;&nbsp; All equipment types, every railroad, every provider, every drayman are able to be considered, which makes finding the best option and cost for the customer&rsquo;s needs more attainable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Non-asset providers invest in expertise, customer service, and technology, not equipment.&nbsp; They aren&rsquo;t tied to managing their investments &ndash; they can focus 100% on service and customizing the best option for each customer based on the customer&rsquo;s needs, not the needs of a network.<\/p>\n\n<h2>So, when looking at asset-based versus non-asset based intermodal providers, be sure to consider these things:<\/h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Will you be shipping based on your schedule or someone else&rsquo;s?<\/li>\n\t<li>Does this fit your needs or someone else&rsquo;s needs?<\/li>\n\t<li>Does your provider have access to all 237,000 domestic containers (plus thousands of 20&rsquo;\/40&rsquo;\/45&rsquo; containers)?<\/li>\n\t<li>Does your provider have access to all providers and all rails?<\/li>\n\t<li>Were all options explored to come up with the best cost?&nbsp;<\/li>\n\t<li>What&rsquo;s more important to your provider: you, or their equipment and network?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>The answers to these questions will help provide you with the best route to getting your goods on the rail and to their final destinations.

Why should you when there&rsquo;s transportation management software that can take care of it for you in a matter of minutes? Here are some examples of manual processes that can be automated using transportation management software (TMS).<\/p>\n\n<h2>Order entry<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Manual Process:<\/strong> Even if you already have a TMS, you might still be doing more work than necessary if your software doesn&rsquo;t have integration capabilities for order entry. You might be stuck typing each order into your enterprise resource planning system (ERP), as well as the TMS.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TMS Solution:<\/strong> If you&rsquo;re currently using an ERP, we can interface with your system, allowing order information to be automatically transferred. This prevents the need for dual entry.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Rate Shopping<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Manual Process:<\/strong> Shopping for shipping rates might be a little tedious if you have to look through each of your carrier&rsquo;s rates on a lane, and that&rsquo;s if they offer contracted rates. If not, emails and phone calls to each available carrier might be necessary for even just a single lane.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TMS Solution:<\/strong> Quickly compare contracted rates or submit instant spot quote requests to multiple carriers at once through our TMS.&nbsp; The carrier quotes are automatically filtered into the system by lowest cost carrier for easy comparison instead of piling up your inbox.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Freight Tendering<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Manual Process:<\/strong> Calling or emailing a carrier to see if they can accept your load can get quite time consuming, especially if you&rsquo;ve got hundreds of loads to cover. In the midst of your work day, it&rsquo;s easy to forget which carriers you&rsquo;ve talked to already, or those you&rsquo;ve missed. This can translate to a long list of uncovered loads at the end of the day.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TMS Solution:<\/strong> Say goodbye to the dozens of phone calls and emails previously used to secure carriers on your loads. With a few clicks in our TMS, you can send a load tender to your preferred carrier, allowing them to accept electronically.&nbsp; If they reject the tender or don&rsquo;t respond in a timely manner, the load&nbsp;&nbsp; automatically goes to the next carrier on your list based on cost, performance, or other parameters defined by your company.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Shipment Tracking<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Manual Process:<\/strong> Many times you won&rsquo;t know a shipment is late until your customer is calling you to complain, if you&rsquo;re not using a TMS. If you are tracking your shipments, you are usually emailing or making several phone calls to find out where your freight is, which can get crazy.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TMS Solution:<\/strong> Spend less time tracking your loads and more time filling your orders. With our TMS, carriers will have the ability to provide their own status updates on each of your loads either manually or automatically through EDI, allowing you to manage by exception.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Reporting<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Manual Process:<\/strong> Financial reports can be a pain to produce manually since it requires merging multiple spreadsheets together or pulling information from several different sources. This is often done in Excel, which has no way of validating of the reports are accurate. Also, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to track carrier performance, since it&rsquo;s hard to see if loads were delivered on time and who shipped which load, all on one spreadsheet. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TMS Solution:<\/strong> Forget spending precious time compiling reports from multiple spreadsheets. Our TMS will give you the ability to generate all of your transportation reports on demand. From gauging your monthly freight spend to rating your carriers&rsquo; performance, if you need it, you can easily access it. Need it on a regular basis? With our TMS, you can schedule reports to be run on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis and even have it automatically emailed to recipients on a distribution list.<\/p>\n\n<p>With the ability to eliminate multiple manual processes, it&rsquo;s easy to see why a TMS allows you to focus on your time and attention on more important things, like widening your profit margin.<\/p>\n\n<p>For more information, or to request a TMS consultation, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/request-a-consultation\">click here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"575","cat_name":"LTL","title":"Refrigerated LTL Shipments: Here\u2019s What You Need to Know","url_title":"refrigerated-ltl-shipments-heres-what-you-need-to-know","entry_date":"1430154840","exerpt":"One of the most complex transportation modes in the logistics industry is refrigerated less-than-truckload (LTL), due to its complexity and limitations. While many shipping providers are not able to accommodate these shipments, those that can will be better able to service your requests if you are aware of the intricacies of this mode of transportation. ","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}reefer.jpg\" style=\"width: 620px; height: 300px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>One of the most complex transportation modes in the logistics industry is refrigerated less-than-truckload (LTL), due to its complexity and limitations. While many shipping providers are not able to accommodate these shipments, those that can will be better able to service your requests if you are aware of the intricacies of this mode of transportation. Despite its complexities, Trinity Logistics is actively working to expand our service offerings for refrigerated LTL. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is it?<\/h2>\n\n<p>In technical terms, refrigerated (or reefer) LTL is the process of shipping refrigerated or temperature-controlled freight that does not require the space of an entire trailer (full truckload). A refrigerated trailer maintains the freight at a specified temperature range to prevent the product from deteriorating or becoming damaged. For example, frozen fish would move under a temperature range of 0 to -10 degrees Fahrenheit, while chilled beverages would move under a range of 36 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Refrigerated LTL ships at a temperature range, not at a specific degree &ndash; we&rsquo;ll provide more information on that later.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What makes it different than other modes of transportation?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Refrigerated LTL is a little different than regular dry LTL, and other modes of transportation, because reefer LTL carriers do not operate within the same pickup time parameters.<\/p>\n\n<p>To put things into perspective, an LTL carrier may be able to pick up just about every day, Monday through Friday. However, a refrigerated LTL carrier has set days that they pick up, depending on the region. For example, if a refrigerated LTL carrier picks up in Los Angeles on Thursdays and Fridays only, then the shipper would not be able to ship anything with them Monday through Wednesday.<\/p>\n\n<p>The same can be said for refrigerated LTL carriers&rsquo; delivery schedules, which also run on a weekly parameter. Meaning that, if a carrier only delivers to Boston on Tuesdays, then freight picked up the week before will only be able to be delivered on the following Tuesday.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that shipping LTL means that other customers&rsquo; freight will be on the same truck as yours. With reefer LTL, freight that needs to be maintained at a similar range in temperature will be put on the same truck. Shipping multiple customers&rsquo; freight on the same trailer is only made possible by this consolidation based on temperature range.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why is it harder to arrange?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Reefer LTL can be difficult to arrange because it revolves around a very limited and specific time schedule. The schedule that the carrier can offer for pickups and deliveries might not coincide with the shipper&rsquo;s needs.<\/p>\n\n<p>Aside from managing shipments within the timeframe offered by the carrier, reefer LTL can be slightly more difficult due to the freight that is hauled. Maintaining proper temperature while in transit can add another layer of complexity to each shipment.<\/p>\n\n<p>On top of the reasons above, there are a limited number of refrigerated LTL providers in the U.S.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Is it expensive?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, due to the equipment needed, as well as the nature of the commodities being hauled, reefer LTL is almost always more expensive than dry LTL. Carriers need to take into consideration the perishability of the shipment, as well as the costs incurred from maintaining the temperature in the trailer when figuring their prices.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How can I get the best rate?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Working with a third-party logistics company (3PL), like Trinity Logistics, can help you get the best rate possible when shipping via refrigerated LTL. 3PL&rsquo;s can secure the best pricing through contracts with reefer LTL carriers, as they have high volumes of freight to move.<\/p>\n\n<p>As an added benefit, working with Trinity can take a lot of hassle out of arranging reefer LTL shipments. Trinity&rsquo;s LTL representatives can take care of quoting, building, and dispatching your pickups. They can also negotiate rates on your behalf, as well as track your shipments from start to finish.

The futuristic truck features a technology that works to keep the truck within lanes and at legal speeds with the use of cameras.<\/p>\n\n<p>At this time, the truck is fitted with the technology to drive itself on highways, but is not completely self-sufficient. Licensed truck drivers are still needed to sit behind the wheel to takeover control for surface roads, exiting highways, or bad weather.<\/p>\n\n<p>When a situation requires a human driver, the truck will sound a loud beep. Otherwise, the truck will stay in its lane and maintain a safe speed and distance from other vehicles on the road, according to Alex Davies, a magazine editor who was at the truck&rsquo;s demonstration. &nbsp;If the driver does not respond to the beep and take over, the truck will begin slowing down until it is at a complete stop.<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}DSC_0191.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 10px 20px; float: right;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>Will this replace truck drivers?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Ground-breaking new technology always stirs up a little bit of fear for those who work in the affected industry, as it could potentially change or replace their job. However, Freightliner has eased some of this anxiety by mentioning that the self-driving truck still needs a driver to monitor it.<\/p>\n\n<p>Some current truckers are not fazed by this new advancement.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Well it&#39;s coming, like it or not. Cars, trucks, planes; there will always have to be someone behind the wheel monitoring the vehicle until they figure out how to get a level 4 fully self-driving vehicle,&rdquo; said Jeffrey Buford, a driver from Riverside, California.<\/p>\n\n<p>Other drivers feel the pitfalls of technology could prevent the extinction of the truck driver position.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I once ran into a scenario where I-30 in Texas was closed for a wreck and police officers were physically directing traffic around the wreck two different ways depending on what vehicle you were driving,&rdquo; said Steve Lapp, a driver from Jacksonville, Florida. &nbsp;&ldquo;Who could possibly determine how the police officer could communicate to a driverless vehicle how to do that?&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Is this the future of the trucking industry or just a fad?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The real question burning in everyone&rsquo;s minds after the debut of this driverless truck is how this technological advancement will impact the trucking and shipping industry. Is this just another buzz topic to be shared on social media and brought up in passing at truck-stops, or is this really something to think of as an imminent reality?<\/p>\n\n<p>Drivers who are skeptical, like Michael Smith, an owner-operator from Jacksonville, Florida, think there won&rsquo;t be a positive outcome from the new line of self-driving trucks.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think a lot of smart people built a smart truck and one day there&#39;ll be a really smart wreck,&rdquo; Smith said.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Freightliner Inspiration truck is currently being tested on roads in Nevada, but the company says the truck won&rsquo;t be widely commercially available for another decade or so. Regardless of opinions, the truck has been passed through legislation and deemed legally operational. The question remains how many other self-driving vehicles will be in the line-up for the race to autonomy.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In my mind I see road trains miles long cruising across the prairies; dedicated lanes and nodal points across the country waiting for drivers for local delivery. I&#39;m looking forward to it,&rdquo; said Steve Singfield, an owner-operator. &ldquo;Anything to keep me safer, more comfortable, relaxed instead of being weary and bodily worn out, is something to embrace rather than to just dismiss with derision.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Sources<\/h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.overdriveonline.com\/photos-video-freightliners-introduction-of-u-s-first-driverless-truck\/?utm_content=bufferadd4c&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">Overdrive<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/alltechconsidered\/2015\/05\/10\/405598189\/coming-soon-to-a-highway-near-you-a-semi-truck-with-a-brain\">NPR<\/a><\/p>"}, {"ID":"579","cat_name":"Intermodal","title":"Are You Getting the Best Bang for your Buck with Intermodal?","url_title":"are-you-getting-the-best-bang-for-your-buck-with-intermodal","entry_date":"1432928100","exerpt":"You might already know that shipping over the rail is a reliable, consistent, and economical way to get your goods where they need to be, but you should take steps to ensure you\u2019re getting the most efficient service.

Here are some insider tips for you to ensure you&rsquo;re getting the biggest bang for your buck.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Examine your supply chain.<\/h2>\n\n<p>When using intermodal transportation, it&rsquo;s important to consider the ebb and flow of your products in the pipeline. Since intermodal shipments often take about a day longer than those over the road, it can be a little more problematic to receive product on a tight schedule if demand spikes. Having a well-planned and organized inventory and management system could be the difference in profit margin for you.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Flexibility is key.<\/h2>\n\n<p>How tight are your pick-up and delivery times? Sometimes railroads&rsquo; schedules might be different than what you planned for. If your inventory is well-managed, perhaps you can wait to have your product delivered until the next day, especially if it can get you that better rate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to factor in drayage as well. Your intermodal shipment might be at the yard, but perhaps a dray can&rsquo;t be there the exact time you hoped for. Having a flexible schedule could get your load there at a more convenient time for everyone involved, and possibly cheaper, too.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Know when intermodal is the best mode.<\/h2>\n\n<p>The real economic advantage to shipping over the rail kicks in for shipments traveling around 600 miles or more. There is often a slight delay compared to shipping over the road &ndash; meaning what would usually take three days to arrive on a truck might take four or five days to arrive if you ship intermodal. Your shipments also must weigh 42,500 pounds or less.<\/p>\n\n<p>So if you&rsquo;re shipping long-haul freight, you&rsquo;re flexible with your delivery dates, and your freight meets the weight requirement, that means intermodal could be the best mode for you.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Block and brace as if your life depended on it.<\/h2>\n\n<p>Blocking and bracing refers to how your shipments are loaded and prepared for transit to ensure that there won&rsquo;t be shifting during transport. Freight that can easily shift around in transit can be at risk for major damages, and since the shipper (you) are held responsible for proper blocking and bracing, that can be an expensive mistake.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re unsure of how to block and brace, work with an intermodal provider, like Trinity, that can arrange for a railroad representative to come and train your employees how to block and brace correctly at no charge to you.&nbsp; Or, if you are familiar with the concept and just have a question with a particular load, Trinity can work with a railroad engineer to build a floor plan that explains in detail how it should be blocked and braced effectively.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Work with a third-party intermodal provider.<\/h2>\n\n<p>As an added bonus, working with third-party rail provider usually means one call does it all. Despite the common belief that the shipper has to arrange the pick-up and delivery of the product before and after the rail portion, Trinity can take care of the shipment door-to-door. Having an intermodal provider manage and track the shipment, as well as send you updates, reduces the time your personnel have to spend being involved in the shipment and therefore can reduce your overhead.<\/p>\n\n<p>Taking all of these tips into consideration could make intermodal shipping even more of a time and money saver for your supply chain.

This will have a significant impact on the shipping and logistics industry, as well as your business, if you ship LTL freight.","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}ltl-stopwatch.jpg\" style=\"width: 620px; height: 250px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) has recently announced that it has updated the policy regarding filing concealed damage claims for LTL (less-than-truckload) shipments. This will have a significant impact on the shipping and logistics industry, as well as your business, if you ship LTL freight.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-two\">What is the big change?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The time to report concealed damages claims to an LTL carrier has been reduced from 15 days to only five. This means that consignees now have five days from delivery to notify the carrier if damages are found after the driver has left the receiver.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-two\">What are concealed damages?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Concealed damages are those that are unnoticeable at first glance by the consignee and found after the freight has been signed for. Examples of this could be a shipment of barbeque sauce with a leaking box in the middle of the pallet, or a box that was accepted, but later found to have a damaged interior product.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concealed damages tend to be more common in LTL shipments. With less freight on the trailer, as is common with LTL, pallets have more room to shift and slide.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-two\">When will the change be effective?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The five day reporting time for concealed damage claims went into effect on April 18, 2015.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-two\">What are the pros and cons?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Like any major amendments to policies, there are both positive and negative effects of the concealed damage claims policy change.<\/p>\n\n<p>As for positives, it&rsquo;s important to note that days of letting potential claims linger are largely eliminated. With over two weeks of time passing from delivery with the old policy, receivers had quite a bit of time to let damages go unnoticed, and finding out about damaged product last minute is bad news for any supply chain. This could also be alarming for carriers who were unaware of the damages until a claim was made 15 days after the fact. Having only a few days to file a claim means receivers will be more on top of their incoming freight, which should catch any possible damages early and reduce the number of concealed damages claims.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, this new change could leave receivers scrambling to sort cargo in a short amount of time. This could put stress on warehouses and docks, as more manpower may be needed to unload and check the loads for damages. This also may cause problems for smaller receivers who may not have the resources to file paperwork and contact carriers, as well as unload shipments, within the five day period.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-two\">How will this impact my business?<\/h2>\n\n<p>If your business receives LTL freight with concealed damages, and you do not report it to the carrier within five days, the process of filing a freight claim becomes much more complicated for the consignee.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, just as the old policy left room for exceptions, so does the new five day policy. In the case of a claim being filed after five days, legitimate proof and documentation will be needed to file these claims and these will be left to the discretion of the LTL carrier.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-two\">What can I do to minimize potential impacts of the policy change?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The number one thing you can do to prepare for the change in policy is to ensure that all consignees and receivers are educated on the change. Those receiving shipments need to be even quicker and particularly diligent about inspecting deliveries and reporting to the carriers in order to have the best chance of a positive outcome if damages are found.<\/p>\n\n<p>Also, taking the proper actions when concealed damage is found can minimize your chances of losing money. When you discover concealed damage, avoid moving the shipment from its original delivery location, take digital photos of the damage, and reach out to your third party logistics company or carrier representative immediately.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keep in touch with your Trinity sales representative for all of the newest updates on logistics policies and industry news.

It was so popular that we decided to address each individual myth in its own blog post. Today, we&rsquo;re going to talk about learning how to use TMS software and the misconceptions about its difficulty.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>Transportation management software (TMS) is an innovative and time-saving tool for businesses who ship freight, but integrating a TMS can definitely feel intimidating when you&rsquo;ve been relying on the same manual processes for some time.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the good news: if you work with the right TMS provider, they can easily remove that fear factor for both you and your team. A user-friendly, easy-to-use TMS can be a complete game changer for your company.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-two\">Is a TMS difficult to implement and use?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t let apprehension about learning and implementing a new TMS prevent you from taking advantage of all of the benefits, like reducing your manual processes and optimizing your shipments to ensure you&rsquo;re getting the best shipping rates.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many TMS options are now web-based rather than desktop versions, so there is nothing to download and no software to install. This makes them easily transportable and mobile in a sense that they can be used from any computer with an internet browser. There&rsquo;s no need to allot certain computers for TMS use.<\/p>\n\n<p>Another additional feature that contributes to the ease of use is the fact that many TMS options are customizable. With the right implementation team, the software can be configured to work within your current process flows rather than forcing your processes into an out-of-box solution.<\/p>\n\n<p>Perhaps one of the best aspects of implementing a TMS is that the right provider will handle the majority of the work. This can include coordinating special projects and working with the right people from your team to accomplish each task.<\/p>\n\n<p>While a TMS can simplify your daily tasks, there still may be a problem that comes up every now and then. The right TMS provider will hold weekly status meetings and will communicate any issues, as they arise, that might jeopardize the &ldquo;go live&rdquo; date for your new system.<\/p>\n\n<h2 class=\"heading-two\">Will it be difficult to train my team on the TMS?<\/h2>\n\n<p>A common concern that holds back potential TMS users is that the training will take too long and be difficult for employees to grasp. However, this really doesn&rsquo;t have to be the case.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are often many ways a TMS can be integrated with any of the programs you are currently using, like an ERP, WMS, or accounting software. This means less training, as all of your current software and processes won&rsquo;t be thrown to the wayside. The right TMS provider will be able to handle multiple integrations to accommodate your specific needs.<\/p>\n\n<p>A capable TMS provider will also be able to provide group training, whether it&rsquo;s virtual or onsite, as it is needed. They can even provide customized user manuals to reflect your TMS setup, and will provide your users with a point of contact who will work one-on-one as needed for additional support.<\/p>\n\n<p>The bottom line here is that a TMS is meant to be easy and reduce your headaches at work, not give you a new one. The right TMS provider, like Trinity Logistics, will be able to integrate the software with your current programs, supply group training sessions, and work with your team on any issues that may arise.<\/p>\n\n<p>To get a TMS consultation, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/request-a-consultation\">click here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"588","cat_name":"Truckload","title":"Understanding Truckload Capacity","url_title":"understanding-truckload-capacity","entry_date":"1436473440","exerpt":"Whether you\u2019re trying to cover a load on the spot market or attempting to predict transportation costs for the next fiscal year, truckload capacity has a huge impact on these processes. How many trucks are available on the road at any given time can be difficult to predict, and there are many components that affect truckload capacity. ","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}tl-capacity.jpg\" style=\"width: 620px; height: 250px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re trying to cover a load on the spot market or attempting to predict transportation costs for the next fiscal year, truckload capacity has a huge impact on these processes. How many trucks are available on the road at any given time can be difficult to predict, and there are many components that affect truckload capacity. To help you better prepare, let&rsquo;s review the major factors:<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.72em; font-weight: 700;\">Seasonal Capacity<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>In the shipping world, there are two major seasons to mark on your calendar. The first is produce season, which starts around April and ends in July. This is the time when produce harvesting hits its peak and those distributing it require a large amount of trucks to haul their loads. &nbsp;Even if you aren&rsquo;t a produce shipper, you could be impacted by the high demand for equipment at this time, especially if you&rsquo;re on the East Coast.<\/p>\n\n<p>Peak season is the other time period to be aware of. It&rsquo;s generally from August to October, adjacent to produce season. This is when sales for customers in the manufacturing and retail industries skyrocket due to everyone going back to school and preparing for the holidays. Shipping volumes shoot up dramatically across the U.S., and this always tightens truckload capacity.<\/p>\n\n<p>While truckers are happy to be hauling a large amount of loads, shippers feel the impact of tightened capacity and shipping costs may go up. The basic economic principle of supply and demand can be applied here. There is a high demand for trucks and drivers, but a lower supply. This is good for truckers, and bad for shippers.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Regional Capacity<\/h2>\n\n<p>You may have found that some areas in the country are considered danger zones for truckers. Some spots in the country are just not attractive to drivers and are colloquially known as &ldquo;black holes&rdquo;. Essentially, this means that drivers may be able to find loads into the area, but have a hard time finding outbound loads to get home (known as backhauls). With that being said, low outbound shipment areas generally have tighter capacity. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Typically, areas with high consumption and high population, but with low numbers of manufacturing and distribution centers in the vicinity, are undesirable spots for truckers, so shipping to these areas will come at a cost. Examples of these places would be Denver, Orlando, Dallas, Seattle, and Phoenix.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Equipment Availability<\/h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s not the driver that&rsquo;s hard to come by, but the equipment itself. Perhaps you need a reefer truck for your produce or a flatbed for your machinery, but there simply aren&rsquo;t any available on that particular lane. This can happen due to any of the previously discussed reasons, but a major one in the pipeline is the equipment crunch set to hit later this year.<\/p>\n\n<p>The holiday rush will begin at the end of August or Early September, which marks peak season for intermodal shipping. Since shipping over the rail requires dray carriers and trailers, truck capacity will tighten. Since the housing market is improving, new construction is on the uptick, and the economy is relatively healthy, peak season should be extremely busy. With truckload capacity issues, this could shape up to be a perfect storm for shippers trying to get their goods to market.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Driver Shortage<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re in the shipping industry, you&rsquo;re likely already aware that the U.S. is experiencing one of the worst periods of truck driver shortage in history.&nbsp; The trucking profession has simply lost its glam as the average driver age hovers around 52 years old, and younger drivers are hard to come by. Truckers are retiring left and right due to low pay rates and the hardships of being away from family for days or weeks at a time, in addition to several new federal restrictions.<\/p>\n\n<p>Larger carriers are experiencing driver turnover rates in the 90% range, which means they need to replace nearly their entire fleet each year. Sure, fleet operators have tried to push incentive programs and pay raises, but the shortage is still prevalent. According to the American Trucking Associations (ATA), the trucking industry is estimated to be short by 35,000 to 40,000 drivers. The stronger the economy grows, the more obvious the shortage becomes.<\/p>\n\n<p>Until the fleet operators and industry leaders are able to figure out a long-term solution to the driver shortage issue, tight truckload capacity will continue to affect you and your business. Shipping rates can go up at a moment&rsquo;s notice, especially on the spot market. This is why working with a high volume third party logistics company (3PL), like Trinity Logistics, is such a game changer for your business.

There is relatively little information published online about these changes right now, even on the FMCSA website, so please check out this information that we&rsquo;ve gathered from the legislation and final rulings published by the FMCSA so that you are prepared for the upcoming changes.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What&rsquo;s happening to MC numbers?<\/h2>\n\n<p>In order to fully understand the change, first you need to be debriefed on the Unified Registration System (URS) ruling. In 2013, the FMCSA published the final rule announcing their switch to the URS, which is an online registration system. They made this change in order to eliminate paper forms in the registration and recordkeeping process for all carriers, brokers, freight forwarders, and other transportation providers. This allows for all of these companies to be tracked in the same system.<\/p>\n\n<p>In this August 23, 2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fmcsa.dot.gov\/sites\/fmcsa.dot.gov\/files\/docs\/URS-Final-Rule.pdf\">ruling<\/a>, it is also mentioned that MC, MX, and FF numbers will no longer be issued once the URS is 100 percent up and running. DOT numbers will be the sole identifier for all companies who are subject to FMCSA regulation, including motor carriers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Before the URS, the FMCSA recognized four identification numbers: The DOT Number, which most motor carriers are required to obtain; the Motor Carrier (MC) Number, which was assigned to non-exempt for-hire motor carriers and brokers; the FF Number, which is assigned to freight forwarders; and the MX Number, which is assigned to Mexico-based carriers operating within the U.S.\/Mexico international border commercial zones.<\/p>\n\n<p>Again, we will reiterate: <strong>according to the final rule, MC numbers, FF numbers, and MX numbers will no longer be a valid form of identification for motor carriers and other transportation providers.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>New carriers and brokers wishing to register with the FMCSA and obtain their authority will need to do so through the URS, and in doing so, will be assigned a DOT number only.<\/p>\n\n<p>The FMCSA has stated that removing your MC number from the side of your vehicle is not required, but it will be obsolete other than for marketing and advertising purposes. With that said, they encourage you to remove these numbers on new and repainted vehicles.<\/p>\n\n<h2>When is this happening?<\/h2>\n\n<p>As of October 23, 2015, all motor carriers, brokers, and freight forwarders that are registering with the FMCSA will need to do so through the URS online registration portal. Applicants will be subject to a $300 registration fee, whether they need operating authority or not. This is also the date that MC, FF, and MX numbers will become obsolete.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why are these changes occurring?<\/h2>\n\n<p>A significant reason for this policy change is to deter carriers from simply obtaining a new DOT number if they get negative safety or compliance marks. Before the URS, obtaining a DOT number was free, so many carriers would rely on this strategy in order to essentially wipe their slate clean.<\/p>\n\n<p>The FMCSA told us they have an entire department dedicated to making correlations between vehicle tags, names, and common DOT numbers to determine which companies are scamming the system and obtaining multiple identification numbers for the same business. So, this has been a real issue in the industry for not only the government, but also for shippers looking to work with safe and compliant carriers.<\/p>\n\n<p>The FMCSA hopes to eliminate these &ldquo;chameleon carriers&rdquo; with this policy change of registering through the URS and assigning only one identification number to each qualifying entity. It&rsquo;s also much more efficient for the FMCSA to only use one number system.<\/p>\n\n<p>Say your final goodbyes to MC numbers, FF numbers, and MX numbers, as DOT numbers will reign supreme as of October 23rd. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, and we&rsquo;ll do our best to point you in the right direction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>**Update as of October 21, 2015:<\/strong> The FMCSA has delayed the MC numbers and URS implementation until September 30, 2016.&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"590","cat_name":"LTL","title":"LTL Shipping: You Get What You Pay For","url_title":"ltl-shipping-you-get-what-you-pay-for","entry_date":"1439499840","exerpt":"The well-known saying \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d definitely rings true when it comes to shipping less-than-truckload (LTL) freight.

There are three distinctly different types of LTL carriers, and you should know when it&rsquo;s better to make the upgrade versus settling for the lowest level of service.<\/p>\n\n<p>The service levels when shipping LTL can be broken down into premium, standard, and economy carriers. The differences between these service levels relate to on-time delivery percentage, possibility of a claim, communication, and billing or correction processes.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Premium LTL Carriers<\/h2>\n\n<p>This is the top tier, cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of LTL shipping.&nbsp; Despite the extra cost, this level of service could be ideal or even necessary for some shipping situations. Premium carriers offer high on-time delivery rates, clear shipment visibility in transit, and a low claims ratio. They also offer the quickest transit time, often within one or two days.<\/p>\n\n<p>In cases where you are completely dependent upon the shipment arriving at a certain time - like special parts for a machine that&rsquo;s down, or product that you&rsquo;re low on - your best bet is to ship premium.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll know exactly where it&rsquo;s headed and when, and most importantly, you&rsquo;ll have it in your hands the day you need it.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Standard LTL Carriers<\/h2>\n\n<p>Standard LTL carriers provide just that; run-of-the-mill LTL shipping. This is the most commonly used level of service. It offers a bit slower transit time than premium shipping, but can still be expected within about two or three days, depending on the distance your shipment is traveling, of course.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re moving moderately valuable freight, like displays or pallet racking, this could still be a good choice, as the standard carriers offer a relatively low claims ratio and decent tracking options. The main difference is that transit time is usually a bit lengthier than with the premium carriers. So, if you don&rsquo;t need those displays right this second, this cheaper option may be a good fit.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Economy LTL Carriers<\/h2>\n\n<p>The lowest level of LTL shipping is with economy carriers. As you might imagine, this is the cheapest option. However, as the title of this blog suggests, the cheapest often doesn&rsquo;t mean the best. This option offers the slowest transit time, lowest visibility for tracking, and a higher claims ratio.<\/p>\n\n<p>We only suggest using this type of carrier if you&rsquo;re shipping low-value and dense freight, such as bricks, paper products, or animal feed. If you order these products well enough in advance to not have an immediate need, this could definitely be the least expensive method of moving them.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How To Choose<\/h2>\n\n<p>Trinity has contracted rates with LTL carriers in the premium, standard, and economy categories to service your LTL needs. Each of these service levels have their pros and cons, and it truly comes down to your priorities. You should consider the timeframe you need the freight moved within, the level of visibility you prefer, as well as your concern about claims.

Let&rsquo;s delve into what this certification means and how choosing a transportation provider with CCP members could make your life easier.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is the certification?<\/h2>\n\n<p>In 1980, a Blue Ribbon Steering Committee meeting was held in D.C. with over 30 shipping executives from all modes of transportation. It was realized at this meeting that standards were needed across the shipping industry for the process of handling freight claims. This led to the creation of the Certified Claims Professional Accreditation Council (CCPAC) and the CCP certification.<\/p>\n\n<p>CCPAC is a non-profit organization that seeks to raise the standards of knowledge and professional competence for those that handle freight claims. Those that have met the requirements of being a member, which includes a comprehensive examination, and proof of education and work experience in the field, are named as Certified Claims Professionals (CCP).<\/p>\n\n<p>The CCP certification serves as proof that an individual exhibits extensive knowledge in the subjects of cargo and freight claims. This includes the preliminary investigation, minimizing loss for all parties, and the claims filing process. This also shows the investment the certificate holder has in the claims field and validates their status as a professional in cargo claims management within the transportation industry.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How does one get the certification?<\/h2>\n\n<p>In order to become a CCP, one must meet the minimum requirements in education and experience in transportation cargo claims, which includes college credits and dedicated work hours to certain claims procedures. Once the educational and experience requirements have been met, the applicant must take and successfully pass the CCP examination.<\/p>\n\n<p>The extensive CCP exam includes questions and essays on topics ranging from bills of lading, cargo insurance, concealed loss or damage contracts, and common carrier liability.<\/p>\n\n<p>After the initial certification, one must refresh their status every three years by fulfilling the continuing education requirements by participation in CCPAC accredited transportation educational courses, organizations, outside seminars, conferences, webinars, or by re-examination.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why should I look for a 3PL that has CCP members?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Not every third-party logistics company has a claims department, let alone one that has CCP members. This should be a consideration when you are deciding on a transportation provider.<\/p>\n\n<p>Those 3PLs that do have an in-house claims team can assist with filing cargo claims that arise when they have arranged the transportation of your shipment. Acting as the liaison between your company and the carrier that moved your freight, they can collect all the paperwork and submit it to the carrier (or their insurance, depending on the amount of the claim) on your behalf.<\/p>\n\n<p>To make things that much better, an in-house claims team with CCP members can provide even more support throughout the claims process, and using their extensive knowledge and experience, may even be able to deescalate and minimize the issue altogether. As they are leading cargo claims professionals in the transportation industry, they will also be the most apt to know about trending claims issues and how to prevent them.<\/p>\n\n<p>Trinity recognizes that the logistics industry is constantly growing and changing. We want experienced, educated team members assisting our customers and carriers with issues concerning cargo claims and managing risk, which is why we have two of our very own CCPs on staff.&nbsp; To learn more about the services we offer, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/freight-services\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"596","cat_name":"Press Releases","title":"Trinity Logistics Named Third Place Winner of Top Workplaces Award in Delaware for 2015","url_title":"trinity-logistics-named-2015-top-workplace-in-delaware","entry_date":"1441375260","exerpt":"We've been announced as a Delaware Top Workplace for the fifth consecutive year!

The world of intermodal shipping is no different. It&rsquo;s important for intermodal logistics companies and shippers to all be aware of what they have control over and should actively work to prevent, versus what incidents are simply anomalies. Let&rsquo;s go over some possible odd ball incidents and who, or what, can prevent them from happening.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Derailment<\/h2>\n\n<p>Trains don&rsquo;t often derail, but when they do, everyone hears about it. The fact is, although it&rsquo;s a rare occurrence, these incidents are usually not preventable-at least not by you or your intermodal provider.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Trains can derail for a variety of reasons: &nbsp;issues with the track, human error, or mechanical issues with the train. Obviously, an intermodal shipping company can&rsquo;t predict or prevent this, but they can help you through the claims process if a derailment occurs, as well as educate you on how to block and brace your shipments to help avoid this. One of the only times a claim can be filed on intermodal shipments and have a real chance of being won, is when the train derails and there were no errors in blocking and bracing the freight.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Train Lateness<\/h2>\n\n<p>Delays can happen with any type of shipment, but trains can sometimes arrive later than predicted due to an array of reasons, whether there&rsquo;s something mechanically wrong with the train, or a strong storm prohibits safe travel. Regardless, this is another situation where it&rsquo;s typically out of the intermodal marketing company&rsquo;s hands.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, modern technological updates to the intermodal industry have allowed for the best tracking methods in its history. With that being said, any type of delay can be instantly communicated to you so that you can plan accordingly. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also recommended that extremely time-sensitive freight not be shipped over the rail, due to lack of control over delays.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Capacity Availability<\/h2>\n\n<p>There might come a time when your intermodal shipping provider informs you of delays or inability to ship at certain times due to capacity. Since there are only a handful of railway companies across the nation, equipment can be in short supply at any given time. This goes for dray carriers, chassis, and containers.<\/p>\n\n<p>You might wonder &ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t I work directly with the rail so I have a better shot at their capacity?&rdquo; Unfortunately, shippers cannot work directly with the rail, only intermodal shipping companies can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.72em; font-weight: 700;\">&nbsp;Weather<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>This seems pretty obvious, but it&rsquo;s worth noting: weather has a mind of its own. This can be particularly obvious when big storms come through, like hurricanes and blizzards.<\/p>\n\n<p>Delays in shipping times are definitely not preventable for these events, but you can be prepared by following approaching storms and monitoring your supply. If you need the freight at the destination as soon as possible before the storm hits, shipping earlier than usual on the rail is one option, or perhaps another mode of transportation, like expedited LTL or truckload, would be a better option.<\/p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, high-tech tracking equipment will keep you updated throughout the shipping process and through any delays.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Improperly Blocked and Braced Shipments<\/h2>\n\n<p>One of the top tips for ensuring your freight arrives in the same condition it left the origin in is to properly block and brace it in the shipping container. This process is slightly different for each shipment based on its size and dimensions. If the shipment is not properly secured, it can shift during transport, which can not only damage your freight, but even cause a derailment in some cases.<\/p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, if your shipment is found to not be blocked and braced properly, it can fall back on you as the shipper, since the shipper is held responsible for the bracing of their shipments. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>No one likes bad surprises, like a delay in shipping or damaged freight, but the good news is Trinity can help with most issues that may cause these problems. Sometimes things just happen, and the intermodal shipping provider may not be to blame. Rest assured, keeping an open line of communication with your intermodal shipping company can minimize potential issues.

It can be hard to keep track of, so we\u2019ve rounded up seven different developments that should be on your radar.","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"no-border\" src=\"{filedir_3}dreamstimemaximum_11725425.jpg\" style=\"width: 620px; height: 211px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>The regulations and requirements in the trucking industry are constantly shifting and changing. It can be hard to keep track of, so we&rsquo;ve rounded up seven different developments that should be on your radar and summarized them below.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Entry-Level Driving Training Requirements<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Overview:<\/strong> There will be an official set of training requirements an entry-level truck driver must meet to be in accordance with the FMCSA. The training will be based in four different areas, including the requirements themselves, hours of service, driver wellness, and whistleblower protection.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Why it&rsquo;s happening:<\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\"> &nbsp;The FMCSA wants to make driver training consistent across the industry. Giving all drivers the same training makes it less likely for one driver to know more or less about the rules and requirements than another. For example, the agency hopes to be able to reduce fatal exhaustion-related crashes caused by those unaware of HOS restrictions, and to protect drivers expressing health or legal concerns from being fired by their employer.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.72em; font-weight: 700;\">2. Transportation and Logistics Hiring Reform Act<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Overview: <\/strong>The &ldquo;Transportation and Logistics Hiring Reform Act&rdquo; (also known as S.1454) is a bill created by Senator Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Roy Blunt (R-MO) that would establish a hiring standard for shippers and third party logistics companies who enlist the services of motor carriers. &nbsp;This would more clearly define who is an acceptable or safe carrier to hire, and who is not.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Why it&rsquo;s happening: <\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">The TIA has brought to the FMCSA&rsquo;s attention that many times, shippers or shipping providers are wrongly made to pay the price in lawsuits regarding incidents where the motor carrier is at fault. In order to combat this, the Act would serve as a guideline for cases to determine if the shipping provider is truly at fault, based on whether they hired a driver that was reasonably anticipated to be one of a safe and legal standard. Only data from the national hiring standard may be used in civil action cases against business entities, which would therefore protect shippers from non-compliant drivers as long as that standard was met.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2>3. Speed Limiter Mandate<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Overview:<\/strong> This is a proposed federal rule that would require the installation and use of speed limiters (also known as Electronic Control Modules) on all trucks weighing more than 27,000 pounds and traveling on roads with a speed limit of at least 55 miles per hour. &nbsp;This would limit the top speed of the vehicle.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Why it&rsquo;s happening: <\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">&nbsp;Advocates for this proposed rule claim that it would eliminate hundreds, if not thousands, of fatal crashes. The bottom line for the FMCSA and the DOT is that safety should be a top concern for all fleet owners and drivers, so they are pushing hard for this technology to become law. There are still talks of exactly what speed limit trucks would be restricted to.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.72em; font-weight: 700;\">4. E-Log Mandate<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Overview: <\/strong>A proposed mandate is in the works to require the use of electronic logging devices (ELD&rsquo;s) for all interstate motor carriers operating commercial vehicles, instead of the old-fashioned method of paper logs for hours of service.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Why it&rsquo;s happening: <\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">The point of requiring ELD&rsquo;s is to make the process of logging hours streamlined and efficient, as well as eliminating the possibility of &ldquo;fudging&rdquo; your logs. This new law would also require that drivers have visibility to the logs their ELDs are recording.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.72em; font-weight: 700;\">5. Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse Mandate<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Overview:<\/strong> This potential law would establish a national drug and alcohol clearinghouse for all commercial drivers, as mentioned in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (&ldquo;MAP-21&rdquo;). &nbsp;This would create a national database for controlled substance and alcohol test result data for CDL holders and establish guidelines for managing the information in the database.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Why it&rsquo;s happening: <\/strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">The FMCSA has heard of multiple cases where an impaired driver had found their way behind the wheel of a commercial motor vehicle, despite the fact that he had failed drug tests with a former employer. The FMCSA hopes to avoid this by providing potential employers with an easy way to access CDL holders&rsquo; historical drug and alcohol test results.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.72em; font-weight: 700;\">6. Driver Coercion Mandate\/E-Logs<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Overview:<\/strong> As an attachment to the E-Log mandate, the FMCSA has proposed a driver coercion mandate. This would prohibit carriers from &ldquo;harassing&rdquo; drivers with the devices. Harassment would be defined as &ldquo;an action involving the use of information available through an ELD that the carrier knew or should have known.&rdquo; Other restrictions to the ELD mandate include instituting complaint procedures, stiffening penalties to deter harassment, as well as privacy guidelines, and requiring mute functionality.<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\"><strong>Why it&rsquo;s happening:<\/strong> The E-Log mandate has received considerable resistance from drivers, as the 2011 version of the rule caused issues in court systems due to harassment. Carriers and shippers were allegedly using the E-Logs of their drivers to harass them during off-duty periods and to intimidate them to work outside of federal safety restrictions. The FMCSA hopes to avoid the same issues by instituting this driver coercion mandate.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.72em; font-weight: 700;\">7. CSA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Safety Fitness Determination&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Overview:<\/strong> There will be a major revision to the method the FMCSA uses for rating trucking companies. There will no longer be relative rankings, only definitive scores. In addition, hazmat BASIC measurements will be public, and the agency is looking to lower the threshold of vehicle maintenance from 80 to 75 and raise the intervention threshold of the controlled substances BASIC from 80 to 90.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s happening: <\/strong>The FMCSA hopes to target more carriers by lowering the interventional threshold for vehicle maintenance, and to target fewer carriers by raising the threshold of controlled substances. Essentially, this means that the agency plans to be stricter on those violating vehicle maintenance regulations, and a bit leaner on those with controlled substances on their record.<\/p>\n\n<p>These new mandates may take some time to become law. As anyone familiar with the transportation industry knows, some of these items may never make it through the lawmaking process. There are no dates set in stone, and many are still awaiting White House approval.&nbsp; Rest assured, we&rsquo;ll keep you in the loop of any changes and dates as they become available.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>**Update as of January 7, 2016:<\/strong>&nbsp;So far, only two out of these seven new regulations have official roll-out dates. E-Log mandates are set to be enforced on December 16, 2017 and driver coercion mandates will be enforced starting on January 29, 2016.

If you&rsquo;ve only ever shipped one mode and not the other, you may not be aware of these differences. If you&rsquo;re an LTL shipper whose business is booming and your shipments have grown to full truckload size, or you&rsquo;re interested in consolidating your LTL shipments into full truckload shipments in order to save money, check out the information below for a brief overview on the differences you can expect to see.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Handling and transit time<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Truckload:<\/strong> When you ship a full truckload, your freight is the only thing on the trailer. Transit time is simple: it&rsquo;s contingent upon the travel time between pickup and delivery points, and required breaks for drivers. The freight never leaves the truck, because it travels directly to the delivery destination. This means truckload shipments tend to arrive faster than LTL shipments do.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>LTL: <\/strong>The longer transit time for LTL is because your freight isn&rsquo;t the only freight on the trailer. There will be multiple stops at terminals and delivery locations to unload other customers&rsquo; freight in addition to yours. This means your freight is also handled quite a bit more than if it were shipped via truckload.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Weight and size of shipments<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Truckload:<\/strong> A typical full truckload shipment can range from 24 all the way up to 30 pallets, depending on the size of the trailer. Since the number of pallets (the space your shipment takes up in the trailer) has more of an impact on whether it requires a full truckload than the weight does, the weight of a truckload shipment commonly varies from under 10,000 pounds to over 45,000 pounds.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>LTL:<\/strong> If you&rsquo;re not in the awkward range that might require a partial truckload shipment (10,000-20,000 pounds and over 6 pallets), and you have at least one pallet, LTL is your best fit. Typical LTL shipments range from 1 to 6 pallets and up to 10,000 pounds.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Cost per shipment<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Truckload: <\/strong>The cost of shipping a full truckload is completely dependent upon the market. There is no set pricing (unless you arrange a contract) and carriers are free to offer you whatever rate they want, depending on the mood they&rsquo;re in or what they ate for breakfast that day. The factors a carrier will take into consideration when offering a rate include the origin and destination, the weight of the shipment, and ultimately, the cost per mile.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>LTL:<\/strong> This is one of the biggest differences between LTL and truckload, as LTL shipping is regulated by an organization called the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) which classifies all freight based on its commodity, density, and ease of transport. LTL carriers have standard rates that are essentially pumped out of an equation, and those rates are determined by your origin and destination, your freight&rsquo;s classification, number of pallets (how much space it takes up on the truck), and any number of accessorials you may need &ndash; for example, a lift gate needed on delivery would be extra. These are all wrapped into the rate, while with a truckload carrier, any accessorials are typically negotiated individually.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Reefer availability<\/h2>\n\n<p><strong>Truckload:<\/strong> Reefer trailers are fairly common and readily available. In general, modern temperature-controlled trailers can range from below zero to seventy degrees. Since it&rsquo;s only your freight on the trailer, the shipment can move on whatever schedule and whatever temperature you need it to. Besides temperature monitoring, and being a bit more expensive, refrigerated truckload shipments aren&rsquo;t all that different from a dry truckload shipment.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>LTL:<\/strong> Refrigerated LTL shipments are a bit different than dry LTL shipments. Most reefer LTL carriers run on strict schedules that are based on certain lanes and temperatures. For example, a refrigerated LTL carrier might pick up in Los Angeles on Thursdays and Fridays only, and may only run at 45-50 degrees. Multiple customers&rsquo; freight is shared on a single reefer LTL trailer with similar temperature ranges in order to maximize efficiencies for the carrier, since a lot of carriers operate on appointment schedules that are set and routed a day or more in advance. This can make finding an available reefer LTL carrier difficult at times, especially on short notice. If you&rsquo;re an LTL shipper who ships temperature controlled freight and you have the potential to size up to truckload, this is a situation where it&rsquo;s very advantageous.<\/p>\n\n<p>Trinity Logistics is a multi-modal 3PL provider and we are here to guide you through whatever transitions you may be dealing with in your transportation needs.

With that being said, it&rsquo;s obvious why this gap is a popular topic, as 86% of top-level decision makers at America&rsquo;s most successful companies are men.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Women in Leadership Roles at Trinity<\/h2>\n\n<p>While these statistics may ring true nationwide, at Trinity Logistics, we&rsquo;re proud to say it&rsquo;s the complete opposite. At Trinity, women hold a staggering 36% of executive or senior level management positions. For first or mid-level management positions (directors and managers), the ratio jumps to 54% women.<\/p>\n\n<p>A veteran Trinity team member, Sarah Ruffcorn, Senior Vice President of Strategic Development, was recently recognized as a Delaware Business Times DBT 40 member for 2015. This is a prestigious recognition of the region&rsquo;s best and brightest young professionals under 40.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t see myself as a female in leadership, I just see myself in leadership with an enormous responsibility to our company and my teams,&rdquo; Ruffcorn said.<span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>At Trinity, those in management positions are given leadership training and expected to follow the model of servant leadership. Male or female, leaders must remove obstacles for their team members daily, and ultimately, put their teams&rsquo; needs first. This idea is illustrated as an upside-down triangle with the leader at the bottom. This unique culture makes for a challenging, yet rewarding experience as a leader, and gender is not a consideration when the best leaders are selected to fulfill these roles at Trinity Logistics.<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Brandy McMullen, a 13-year Trinity veteran, started her career as a logistics specialist, but is now Vice President of Administrative Services.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What has shaped me as a female leader is the fact that I&rsquo;ve been a mom for five years now, and I can tell you that I am a better leader now than I was before kids,&rdquo; McMullen said. &ldquo;I attribute that back to a trial-by-fire ability to multi-task and nurture the development in others.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Our high percentage of female leaders may be partially accounted for by Trinity&rsquo;s family-friendly atmosphere. Trinity encourages women to not only follow their career goals, but to advance in their personal lives as well. To help provide a welcoming environment for women wishing to grow their families and to cut back on team members feeling the need to leave in order to do so, Trinity provides a &ldquo;mother&rsquo;s room&rdquo; for nursing moms and a paid maternity leave program.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Gender Gap in the Transportation Industry&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>The transportation industry is a highly competitive world, with new logistics companies popping up each day. However, according to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/opub\/reports\/cps\/women-in-the-labor-force-a-databook-2014.pdf\">2014 Bureau of Labor Statistics study<\/a>, women make up only 23% of workers in transportation as a whole. In fact, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.truckinginfo.com\/news\/story\/2015\/10\/few-women-hold-director-and-executive-positions-in-trucking-wit-survey-finds.aspx#.VkHj1NK20D8.email\">2015 Women In Trucking Association study<\/a> shows that&nbsp;women make up only about 19% of director positions in trucking.<\/p>\n\n<p>Jennifer Braun, Vice President and General Manager of Trinity&rsquo;s Kansas City office, notices the uneven ratio in the industry on a day-to-day basis.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;There is a big gender gap in transportation, more so than in other industries, and a talent gap as well for people educated in supply chain and logistics,&rdquo; Braun said. &ldquo;So, to find an educated and experienced woman in transportation is uncommon.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>At Trinity, female team members know their work ethic and accomplishments are what sets them apart, not their gender. Stacey Howell worked her way up from Administrative Assistant to Vice President of LTL in just nine years.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe there is still a huge gender gap in Corporate America, and while it is gradually looking better for women year over year, it is still mostly considered a man&rsquo;s world,&rdquo; Howell said. &ldquo;I, however, am one of the lucky ones; I have found a home with Trinity Logistics where they promote within based on a job well done, not on gender.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<h2>Learn more<\/h2>\n\n<p>To learn more about careers at Trinity, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/company\/careers\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"603","cat_name":"Truckload","title":"The 2015 Highway Funding Bill: Here\u2019s What You Should Know","url_title":"the-2015-highway-funding-bill-heres-what-you-should-know","entry_date":"1447766460","exerpt":"If you\u2019ve scanned through the news lately, you may have seen some mentions of the highway funding bill as it has reached different stages of legislature.

Perhaps you&rsquo;re wondering what this really means and how it might impact you. Whether you&rsquo;re a trucker or a regular commuter, this bill could have an effect on your wallet and your travels. Let&rsquo;s go over the basics.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is the highway funding bill?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The highway funding bill is a transportation law that would authorize six years&rsquo; worth of construction and maintenance of roads, bridges, and transit systems across the country, totaling up to $325 billion. Considering large portions of the nation&rsquo;s highways and bridges are in rough shape, and deteriorating more every day, this is something needed to keep America moving. In this six year plan, three years would be fully funded.<\/p>\n\n<h2>When will it take effect?<\/h2>\n\n<p>At this point, a similar bill has been passed in both the Senate and most recently, the House. The next step would be for the bill to be discussed at a conference committee comprised of members from each house of Congress. The goal is to combine the bills to form something both the House and Senate can agree on. If they do, it moves on to the President to become law.<\/p>\n\n<p>The deadline for the conference committee to submit a written document to be approved by the House and Senate is November 20, 2015 in order to avoid a gap in funding.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why is it taking so long to be made law?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>The highway funding bill has been tossed around for years now, since there has been little bipartisan effort on methods to find funds to support it. In fact, in July of 2015, a three-month bill was passed in order to give Congress time to figure out a multiyear plan before funds were completely cut off.<\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, the main issue of the highway funding bill all comes down to money. The first three years of the six year bill are funded, but the question is the last three years. To understand how transportation and infrastructure costs are covered, it&rsquo;s important to know about the Highway Trust Fund.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Highway Trust Fund is the primary way in which federal highway and transit programs are funded for state, local, and national projects across the country. This trust is supported by revenue from two different taxes: a gas tax Americans pay at the pumps, and truck-related taxes usually paid by truck manufacturers and tire retailers.<\/p>\n\n<p>Going back to the issue of funding the highway bill, the part that is causing a debate in Congress is the issue of raising these taxes that back the Highway Trust Fund. Democrats want to up the taxes, and Republicans want to keep them low.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many say this current highway funding bill is another band-aid fix, as the issue of coming up with the actual funds is still an unanswered question for the second half of the bill. Obama himself is pushing for a package closer to $500 billion to cover much needed projects across the country, which would require more approval for funds and a still-disputed answer of where it will come from if not from transportation taxes.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How will this affect me?<\/h2>\n\n<p>If a solution is not passed by November 20, 2015, it is possible that funds will be cut off for transportation projects. This means that roads in poor condition may remain that way until the highway bill can be officially made into law.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the bill is passed, be prepared for more roadwork and construction zones nationwide as projects that may not have had the funds before, will be given the green light. This may cause more traffic jams temporarily, but is better than the alternative, which is dangerous roadways that cause even more wear and tear on vehicles long term.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the bill passes, it remains to be seen where the additional funds will come from. If taxes are indeed raised, truckers and regular commuters alike can expect to pay more travel-related taxes.<\/p>\n\n<p>We will be monitoring the situation as the deadline passes towards the end of this month and provide updates as necessary.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"606","cat_name":"Truckload","title":"Driver Coercion Ruling: Here\u2019s What You Need to Know","url_title":"driver-coercion-ruling-heres-what-you-need-to-know","entry_date":"1451405700","exerpt":"At the end of November, the FMCSA published a new rule that will prohibit truck driver coercion.

This affects motor carriers and other transportation parties, including shippers and receivers. Let&rsquo;s go through what you need to know.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2>What is the ruling?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The new FMCSA ruling makes driver coercion illegal. Driver coercion is defined as behavior and communication that would entice or intimidate a commercial motor vehicle driver to drive outside of legal operating restrictions, including hours-of-service (HOS) and CDL regulations. &nbsp;An example of this would be a carrier threatening to &nbsp;punish or fire a driver for refusing to accept a load that would require driving outside of the federally regulated HOS limits.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is considered driver coercion?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The FMCSA <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fmcsa.dot.gov\/safety\/coercion\">said<\/a> that the following must have happened in order for coercion to have occurred:<\/p>\n\n<p>1. &nbsp;A motor carrier, shipper, receiver, or other transportation intermediary requested that a driver perform a task that would directly result in the driver violating Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, Hazardous Materials Regulations, or Federal Motor Carrier Commercial Regulations.<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">2. Following the questionable request, the driver informed the party requesting the task that accepting would violate federal regulations.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>3. There then must be a threat or action against the driver&rsquo;s employment or work opportunities to get the driver to take the load or deliver the shipment, knowing this would require the driver to break regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>When does it go into effect?<\/h2>\n\n<p>This new ruling will take effect on January 29, 2016. The FMCSA will also begin accepting coercion complaints from drivers on that date.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why is this happening?<\/h2>\n\n<p>According to the FMCSA, financial and unreasonable economic pressure in the transportation industry can inhibit overall safety. If drivers are pressured about loads to the point of committing unlawful acts to fulfill the request, this obviously creates a hazardous situation.<\/p>\n\n<p>This new ruling gives the FMCSA a way to pinpoint troublemakers. Those who coerce drivers negatively impact the overall welfare of not only the drivers, but everyone traveling the roadways. Those found to be in violation of this new law can be fined up to $16,000 per incident.<\/p>\n\n<p>To learn more about the driver coercion ruling, visit the FMCSA&rsquo;s website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fmcsa.dot.gov\/safety\/coercion\">here<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"607","cat_name":"Truckload","title":"New for 2016: Stricter Shipping Requirements at the Canadian Border","url_title":"new-for-2016-stricter-shipping-requirements-at-the-canadian-border","entry_date":"1452529140","exerpt":"All shippers and carriers who handle shipments traveling from the U.S. to Canada should be aware of new regulations that go into effect this month.

Here&rsquo;s a review of the the upcoming changes involving shipping documentation and the consequences of not adhering to these requirements.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What are the new regulations?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Your bill of lading, which should include weight, commodity, and piece count, must be sent to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) at least one hour before the shipment arrives at the border.<\/p>\n\n<p>More specifically, the bill of lading must have an extremely detailed description of the freight, which should match the invoice, and it must contain the correct weight and piece count. In addition, the Canadian consignee address must be accurately listed, including the correct street type identifier (for example, &ldquo;boulevard&rdquo;, &ldquo;street&rdquo;, or &ldquo;road&rdquo;).<\/p>\n\n<p>This means that vague or generic commodity descriptions are now unacceptable at the Canadian border. If the bill of lading says the shipment is &ldquo;apparel,&rdquo; that isn&rsquo;t detailed enough for the CSBA. You&rsquo;d need to indicate &ldquo;men&rsquo;s jackets&rdquo; or &ldquo;women&rsquo;s dresses&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t write &ldquo;appliances&rdquo; if you&rsquo;re really hauling refrigerators or microwaves.<\/p>\n\n<p>Specificity is now required for the consignee&rsquo;s address, as well. If you just write &ldquo;12345 Wood&rdquo; and leave out the &ldquo;Boulevard&rdquo; by mistake, you may have to pay.<\/p>\n\n<h2>When do these rules go into effect?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The CBSA will begin enforcing the regulations on Monday, January 11, 2016.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What are the consequences of breaking the rules?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Those not obeying these regulations are subject to strict fines that can reach over $10,000 per shipment. You could be fined if there&rsquo;s any inaccurate information on your bill of lading, including the piece count, consignee address or commodity description, or if the bill of lading does not match the commercial invoice.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How will this affect my business?<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you, as the shipper, fail to comply with these new regulations by not providing accurate information, it could result in service delays and, of course, monetary fines through the CBSA&rsquo;s Administrative Monetary Penalty System (AMPS). These fees would be tacked on to your shipping costs, and no one likes paying more money than necessary to get a job done.<\/p>\n\n<p>To prevent possible fines and consequences, be sure to include both accurate and extremely detailed notes about your cargo, and supply a matching invoice to back them up. Keeping a clear line of communication with your Trinity representative about your freight will help your shipments crossing the Canadian border to arrive smoothly to their destination.

While there are many 3PLs (third-party logistics companies) in the shipping world, 4PLs are the new kids on the block. Let\u2019s go over the differences between the two. ","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}3plvs4pl.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 200px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>You may have heard the term &ldquo;4PL&rdquo; buzzing around the transportation industry. While there are many 3PLs (third-party logistics companies) in the shipping world, 4PLs are the new kids on the block. Let&rsquo;s go over the differences between the two.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is a 3PL?<\/h2>\n\n<p>To put it in simple terms, a third-party logistics company is a provider of outsourced logistics services, often including freight shipping arrangement and warehousing. The term &ldquo;logistics&rdquo; really covers a spectrum of services, all dealing with the management of the way freight gets from one place to another.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is a 4PL?<\/h2>\n\n<p>As of right now, there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an official definition for what a 4PL company does, since it&rsquo;s such a new and shifting idea. With that being said, there&rsquo;s definitely a common understanding of the term. To best break it down, let&rsquo;s talk about all of the different &ldquo;PLs&rdquo;.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you consider what &ldquo;1PL&rdquo; and &ldquo;2PL&rdquo; might mean, a 1PL would be considered the shipper and 2PLs would be asset-based carriers. 3PLs are the match-making link between the two.<\/p>\n\n<p>A 4PL, then, would manage a network of 3PLs on behalf of their customer (the shipper), in addition to providing the technology needed by the customer. Think of a 4PL as the &ldquo;eye-in-the-sky&rdquo; that determines which providers would best suit their customers&rsquo; shipping and logistics needs. The 4PL takes control of the ins and outs of these outsourced parties and becomes the main point of contact for the customer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>But wait&hellip; how is that any different from a 3PL?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The main difference would be the control and responsibility a customer would have, or need to have, when it comes to their supply chain. By hiring a 4PL in a contracted relationship, a logistics manager would essentially &ldquo;give up&rdquo; the responsibility to find the best logistics companies or carriers to take care of getting their shipments from one place to another. The 4PL would take care of all coordination of these parties behind the scenes (at a cost, of course).<\/p>\n\n<p>Shippers who use one or more 3PLs are still responsible for finding and managing&nbsp; the relationships with these providers, along with any asset-based carriers they also work with. These shippers tend to work with many different providers in order to obtain the best service and pricing possible for each lane and mode of transportation they need. &nbsp;By managing your own logistics providers, the decision is up to you &ndash; there are no contracts requiring you to work with any certain providers.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Which is best to work with? &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n<p>Both 3PLs and 4PLs have their perks in regards to ease of use and cost savings. At the end of the day, choosing between the two depends on what you&rsquo;re looking to get out of your supply chain management. If you&rsquo;re looking for a &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; approach to your company&rsquo;s logistics and someone to just take care of the entire process from start to finish, contracting a 4PL may be your best bet.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, if you&rsquo;re looking for more flexibility and would like to maintain control over your transportation processes, working with a 3PL is likely a better fit for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>While Trinity Logistics fits the definition of a 3PL, we also offer 4PL services for those customers who want to outsource more and more of their logistics processes. From transportation management software to full-on freight management, we now deliver a wide array of offerings to provide you with that higher level of service, while still maintaining the benefits of working with a 3PL.

The FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association) recently announced that a final ruling has been established for these e-logging devices and when their usage will become mandatory.","content":"<p><img alt=\"eld; eld mandate\" src=\"{filedir_3}ELD.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 300px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ve likely heard about the electronic logging device (ELD) mandate over the past few years, as it has been a popular and controversial topic within the transportation industry and the legislative world. The FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association) recently announced that a final ruling has been established for these e-logging devices and when their usage will become mandatory.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is the ruling?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The basic premise of the new mandate is that all commercial motor carriers must use certified, registered ELDs to record their driving time. The FMCSA will require these electronic devices in order to eliminate the usage of paper logs, which will also eradicate the errors and inconsistencies that can arise from manual logging. These &ldquo;e-logs,&rdquo; as they&rsquo;re commonly called in the industry, will automatically record driving time based on the vehicle&rsquo;s engine, movement, location, and miles driven. Therefore, the technology provides a foolproof way to track hours of service.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Why is it going into effect?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Currently, there are a variety of methods used to log driving time across the industry. For many, it&rsquo;s using paper and pencil, and for others, automatic onboard recording devices (AOBRDs) are used. This means more work to sync and consolidate data from multiple sources. The FMCSA estimates that by switching to ELDs, there will be an annual net benefit of more than a billion dollars.<\/p>\n\n<p>More importantly, however, the FMCSA also estimates that 26 lives will be saved and 562 injuries involving large commercial vehicles will be prevented by being able to more accurately track and enforce drivers&rsquo; hours of service. While a paper log can be &ldquo;fudged&rdquo; in order to hide an hours of service violation, permitting a trucker to drive for a longer period of time than allowed by law, the e-logs will clearly indicate when a driver has broken the hours of service regulations, discouraging this behavior. The FMCSA strongly believes that getting drivers off the road before they are fatigued will prevent accidents.<\/p>\n\n<h2>When is it going into effect?<\/h2>\n\n<p>There are two different enforcement dates, depending upon the logging methods that a carrier is currently using. For those using paper logs or logging software, the transition to using ELD&rsquo;s must occur no later than December 18, 2017. For those currently using AOBRDs or non-compliant version of ELDs, the transition to the new e-logging devices must occur by December 16, 2019.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What are the consequences for not abiding?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The FMCSA is still currently discussing possible consequences of not abiding by the new ELD mandate, as the first compliance date is still two years away. However, as with any mandate, it&rsquo;s better to just be prepared and be in compliance as soon as you can. Another type of consequence that should be noted is this: since ELDs will more accurately record hours of service (HOS), this will make any HOS violation far easier to discover. These violations carry the potential of thousands of dollars&rsquo; worth of fines.<\/p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re closely monitoring the ELD situation as it unfolds.

There are many factors you should consider when making this important decision.","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}factors3pl.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 200px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve never worked with a 3PL (third party logistics) company, you might not know how to go about selecting a reputable provider for you and your freight. There are many factors you should consider when making this important decision.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to avoid the possible problems that can arise from using a 3PL of lesser standards, check out this list of important things to consider before you allow them to arrange your shipments. To ensure you&rsquo;re getting competitive rates while still working with a suitable 3PL, take into account these factors:<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Who are you really entrusting your freight to?<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you wouldn&rsquo;t trust a stranger with your child, you shouldn&rsquo;t trust a stranger with your freight, either. Don&rsquo;t pass off your precious cargo to just anyone. A 3PL is only as trustworthy as their carrier network. You should ask if your 3PL has a carrier compliance management system in place, and also check to see that they&rsquo;re monitoring their carriers&rsquo; safety ratings and insurance. A top-notch provider will do everything possible to vet the carriers they&rsquo;re working with, while a more unscrupulous company might just offer your freight to the first carrier who raises their hand.<\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">2. Do they have substantial industry experience, or are they the new kid on the block? <\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s always better to work with a company that&rsquo;s been around long enough to know all the ins and outs of the transportation and logistics industry. Not only should you be looking for a company with more than a year or two of experience, but they should also have a positive reputation to go with that experience. If they&rsquo;ve got a reputation for freight going missing or shady business practices, chances are, those rumors have some truth behind them. Do your research.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.72em; font-weight: 700;\">3. Is your 3PL financially stable? &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>Working with a 3PL that isn&rsquo;t financially healthy could prove to be disastrous. A company that is unstable might not be paying their carriers on time, which could mean less reliable carriers are handling your freight. Aside from that, entrusting your shipments to a company that could be closing its doors next week isn&rsquo;t exactly the best way to protect your own business. A reputable 3PL should be able to provide you with an honest picture of their financial situation.<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.72em; font-weight: 700;\">4. Do they have a claims management department to offer negotiation on your behalf?<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>No one likes to think about things going south when it comes to shipping freight, but the truth of the matter is that it can happen sometimes, even if you&rsquo;re working with the best 3PL out there. With that being the case, it&rsquo;s important to consider how the 3PL handles those issues as they arise. If a 3PL has a claims team who will act as the middle man and negotiate your freight claims with carriers, they&rsquo;re offering you a valuable service that shouldn&rsquo;t be overshadowed by a cheaper shipping quote from a different provider.<\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">5. Are they a one-stop shop for all of your freight and logistics needs?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">A solid 3PL should be able to provide you with multiple modes of transportation like truckload, LTL, and intermodal, as well as other logistics services like transportation management software, warehousing, and freight management. In addition, do they offer analytics and reporting for your shipments? Sometimes, the convenience of working with a company that knows your needs inside and out is worth the extra penny.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Considering these factors before choosing a 3PL could save you a ton of money and unnecessary stress. Always remember to look at a shipping quote as just one piece of the puzzle, and not let it be the only reason you choose who will be arranging your shipments.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>"}, {"ID":"615","cat_name":"Carriers","title":"Pets Riding Shotgun: Truckers\u2019 Pets on the Road","url_title":"pets-riding-shotgun-truckers-pets-on-the-road","entry_date":"1455912120","exerpt":"Being in the transportation industry, we\u2019ve heard stories here and there about truckers and their companions on the road.

While it\u2019s true that by going this route, you can work directly with the carrier that will be physically hauling your shipments, you may be missing out on some extra perks.","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}3plvsassetbased.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 200px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>When searching for the perfect carrier to move your freight, you might find yourself wondering how to decide between an asset-based carrier and a non-asset based provider (also known as a third-party logistics company, or 3PL). Working with a company that has their own fleet of equipment might seem like the obvious answer as to who you should call to move your freight. While it&rsquo;s true that by going this route, you can work directly with the carrier that will be physically hauling your shipments, you may be missing out on some extra perks.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Capacity<\/h2>\n\n<p>First, there&rsquo;s the issue of capacity. With an asset-based provider, the capacity they have is whatever their particular fleet can handle at the time. This can range from one or two trucks to hundreds of trucks, depending on the size of the company. With truckload capacity being tighter than ever over the past few years, having access to only a small number of trucks can be risky business. If your asset-based carrier of choice is booked up, your freight may end up on the back burner.<\/p>\n\n<p>You might imagine that working directly with an asset-based carrier would lead you to build better relationships, and thus, better access to capacity, but by working with a 3PL, your network would increase dramatically. By building relationships with one or two sales reps at a 3PL, you&rsquo;ve secured a network of thousands of carriers, and greatly increased the capacity you have access to.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Daily Freight Management<\/h2>\n\n<p>Many shippers often find themselves wishing they could save time when it comes to scheduling and tracking their freight, or managing inevitable issues like delays and breakdowns. Working with an asset-based company means you&rsquo;re on your own when these things happen, and it&rsquo;s up to you to work it out with the carrier.<\/p>\n\n<p>Time is truly of the essence when it comes to freight management, and no one knows this better than an experienced 3PL. This is why 3PLs are a good choice for those looking to save a little time in their daily freight management. A 3PL works out any issues that arise with the carrier directly, and only involves you if necessary.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Risk<\/h2>\n\n<p>Finding asset-based carriers on your own may leave you wide open for potential risk, from freight claims to stolen cargo or worse. Unless you have procedures in place to vet the asset-based carriers you&rsquo;re working with, you could end up getting scammed, working with an uninsured driver, or someone who is non-compliant with government regulations. Working with a 3PL who has a carrier compliance department would ensure that only highly vetted carriers are hauling your freight. Any reputable 3PL will do their best to build a carrier base that is compliant and trustworthy.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re used to working with asset-based carriers, hiring a 3PL to handle your shipments may come off as a little intimidating at first, as working with a &ldquo;middle man&rdquo; may be different than what you&rsquo;re accustomed to. However, be careful to not let your hesitation cost you both time and money, as you may be missing out on valuable pros that come with working with a 3PL.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in how a 3PL, like Trinity, could help make managing your freight easier, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/get-a-quote\">click here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"619","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"February Transportation News Update","url_title":"february-transportation-news-update","entry_date":"1457126820","exerpt":"February was all about mandates and regulations in the transportation world.

Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of a few of the top stories from the month.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Speed Limiter Mandate Delayed<\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">The DOT pushed back the publication date for a new regulation that would require speed limiters on heavy-duty commercial vehicles. Originally, the rule was supposed to be published on February 15th, but it&rsquo;s now been pushed to March 15th.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">These speed governors would be required on all trucks weighing over 27,000 pounds, and as a joint effort with the FMCSA, is cited to help reduce accidents involving these large vehicles. However, this rule has been in limbo since May 2015.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">2. CDL Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse Projected to be Published in June<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">A final ruling that would establish a CDL drug and alcohol clearinghouse has now been projected to be sent to the White House this March and to be published in June. This particular rule would create a database of all of those holding commercial driver&rsquo;s licenses (CDLs) that have either failed or refused drug tests and would require carriers to upload this information directly to the FMCSA annually.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">This is part of the FMCSA&rsquo;s ongoing safety efforts. The idea behind this particular ruling is to give potential employers an easy way to access CDL holders&rsquo; historical drug and alcohol test results and avoid hiring impaired drivers.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">3. Has the 34-Hour Restart Rule Been Removed from Legislation?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">The controversial ruling, which requires commercial motor vehicle drivers to take an off-duty rest that includes two 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. periods within 34 consecutive hours, is back in limbo. Due to an oversight, it seems it may have been unintentionally removed from legislation.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">The Truckload Carrier&rsquo;s Association (TCA) has recently reported that upon examining the clause of the published rule that governs restart provisions in the new FAST Act, it doesn&rsquo;t actually contain any language that directly addresses the restart provision. In other words, the 34 hour restart rule is gone, and there is no restart rule mentioned to abide by.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">However, the TCA and the American Trucking Associations are still urging carriers not to change how they&rsquo;re currently managing their drivers, as they predict that the FMCSA will fix the oversight before the updated restart rule is officially published.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>As with any transportation news updates, we&rsquo;ll be updating you as soon as new information is available.

Needing to seek out carriers for each mode of transportation &nbsp;that you require costs you time, money, and resources. This is why working with a one-stop shop logistics solutions provider can save you from a major headache.<\/p>\n\n<h2>You&rsquo;ll only need to establish a relationship with one party.<\/h2>\n\n<p>Working with a third-party logistics company (3PL) that is able to provide multiple modes of transportation including truckload, less-than-truckload (LTL), intermodal, and international, as well as technology solutions, gives you an all-in-one avenue to get your freight where it needs to go in the most cost and time-efficient manner.&nbsp; A 3PL, like Trinity, will assign you to a single sales representative that will be your main point of contact for shipments of any kind, versus needing to establish relationships with multiple representatives across multiple shipping companies.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Time is money.<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got your employees tied up in rate shopping and tracking shipments, you could be wasting some of your most valuable resources. Whether you&rsquo;re currently working with multiple 3PLs or routing your shipments through asset-based carriers, you might be wasting more time than you think. By working with a one-stop shop , youcan free up your team to accomplish bigger and better tasks. Let your solutions provider do all of the dirty work behind getting your shipments where they need to go.<\/p>\n\n<h2>More volume to one provider means lower shipping rates.<\/h2>\n\n<p>The higher volume of shipments you&rsquo;re able to provide to a single 3PL, the more leverage they&rsquo;ll have with carriers to negotiate shipping rates.

Perhaps one of the most relieving aspects of working with a one-stop shop is eliminating the need to pay multiple invoices to a range of carriers.

Many people don&rsquo;t realize that even if you aren&rsquo;t in the produce business, this can still affect your supply chain. Not sure exactly what this means for shipping your freight? Let&rsquo;s go over the facts so you can be prepared.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What does produce season do to truckload capacity?<\/h2>\n\n<p>From early spring to summer, crop harvest volumes are at an all-time high across the nation. More crops means more produce that needs to get to market, and thus, more trucks needed on the road. With trucks in higher demand, especially on the southern East Coast, capacity gets tight every year around this time.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since produce is time-sensitive, and farms are usually in close quarters with each other, trucks can be especially hard to come by within specific, small geographical areas and within particular timeframes. The proximity of your pickup and drop-off locations to these areas can really have a big impact on the availability of trucks for your loads. This can also mean higher shipping rates are required to secure these highly sought after trucks.<\/p>\n\n<p>Produce is almost always shipped on reefer (refrigerated) trucks, and since there&rsquo;s a lot of freight needing to be moved, this especially cuts down on available refrigerated equipment during produce season. Unfortunately, since this type of commodity is so time-sensitive, intermodal or other alternative modes of transportation aren&rsquo;t very popular options. This means capacity will be even tighter if your freight requires refrigerated equipment.<\/p>\n\n<p>In summary: during produce season, peak volumes of fruits and vegetables are ready to be shipped to grocers around the country, demand for trucks gets higher, capacity gets tighter, and shipping rates may go up.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How can working with a 3PL, like Trinity Logistics, help me during produce season?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Whether you ship produce or not, working with a non-asset based shipping company like a 3PL can provide you with access to thousands of carriers available to ship your freight. Trinity works with a network of over 30,000 vetted carriers. The larger the network of carriers, the more likely a truck can be found that&rsquo;s ready and willing to move your freight. Working with a multi-modal company can also provide you with other shipping options, like intermodal, if truckload capacity becomes an issue and there are acceptable alternatives for the commodity you&rsquo;re shipping.<\/p>\n\n<p>Trinity Logistics is also a member of the Produce Marketing Association (PMA). This means that educated sales reps familiar with the produce industry are arranging the shipment of your time-sensitive and high-value produce. Our common practices include asking carriers to check the pulp (internal) temperature of the produce to check if it&rsquo;s warm before loading, providing daily tracing updates, and encouraging remote temperature readings from carriers.<\/p>\n\n<p>We have over 200 actively shipping customers in the produce industry.

Here are a few of the major updates.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. Mexican Truck Inspection Standard Officially Accepted<\/h2>\n\n<p>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) recently announced that it is officially accepting Mexico&rsquo;s standard for annual commercial vehicle inspections for Mexican motor carriers operating in the United States.<\/p>\n\n<p>In Mexico, there&rsquo;s a specific annual inspection that motor carriers must pass to be legal. This is called Norma Oficial Mexicana (NOM), which just means Official Mexican Standard. As of March 16th, as long as Mexico-domiciled carriers have a copy of their NOM inspection report and a sticker decal affixed to their vehicle, the U.S. agrees to honor it and pass the vehicle in its own annual inspection.<\/p>\n\n<p>This might seem like Mexican carriers are getting off the hook, but truthfully this eliminates the possibility of them relying on their own employees to conduct their inspections, or going to commercial garages instead of getting inspections from a legitimate government source.&nbsp; From now on, they must have their official inspections done by the Mexican government.<\/p>\n\n<h2>2. Safety-Fitness Rulemaking Comment Period Extended<\/h2>\n\n<p>The safety fitness determinations for motor carriers have been in the pipeline for some time, and it looks like that&rsquo;s still going to be the case for now.<\/p>\n\n<p>On January 21, the FMCSA published a proposed ruling that would establish a methodology for determining if a carrier is safe to operate a commercial motor vehicle. This includes the carrier&rsquo;s performance in conjunction with the fixed failure threshold, investigation results, and on-road safety data. Essentially, instead of being judged as satisfactory, conditional, or unsatisfactory, carriers would either be stamped as fit or unfit. Those found to be unfit would need to improve in the noted categories or cease operations.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since there was controversy even before the official proposal was published, the FMCSA has granted an extended period of time to hear public comments on issues and improvements. The approval of extension of the comment period comes in the wake of petitions by several trucking associations against the proposed rule, due to the accusation that it would violate the somewhat-lengthy rulemaking process established by the FAST Act.<\/p>\n\n<h2>3. New Entry-Level Driver Training Rule Proposed<\/h2>\n\n<p>On March 4, the FMCSA proposed a new rule aimed at entry-level CDL applicants.<\/p>\n\n<p>Under the suggested rule, those applying for a Class A CDL (for operating a tractor-trailer vehicle over 26,000 pounds) would be required to log a minimum of thirty hours of behind-the-wheel training from an FMCSA-certified instructional program. Applicants pursuing a Class B CDL (needed to operate a heavy straight truck, bus, or motor coach) would be required to log a minimum of fifteen hours of certified training, with seven of those being practice range training.<\/p>\n\n<p>If an entry-level driver training rule sounds familiar, it&rsquo;s because a similar initiative has been in the works for years, even as far back as 2012. It was controversial when it was first revealed and is still a bit muddy. Those opposing the idea fear that putting a minimum number of behind-the-wheel training hours into regulations might falsely convey that a driver is competent and ready to operate a large vehicle on public roadways simply because they have that experience. In other words, they believe it implies that just because an applicant has driven thirty hours during their instruction period, they are safely able to drive on their own.<\/p>\n\n<p>The proposed rule is now under a thirty day public comment period and many trucking associations are expected to speak to it.

This is a federal initiative to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution created by freight transportation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>This is a group effort, bringing together major freight shippers, trucking companies, railways, and logistics companies. The goal is make supply chains more efficient, reducing the energy and fuel required to get products to market. This lessens the release of carbon dioxide and other harmful emissions into the atmosphere. Since its inception, the SmartWay Program has saved $24.9 billion dollars in fuel costs and 107.3 million barrels of oil, which is equivalent to taking 14 million cars off the road for an entire year.<\/p>\n\n<p>To maintain this partnership, we must report our freight and emissions activity to the EPA annually, as well as show a commitment to constantly improving our efficiency.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Intermodal Shipping<\/h2>\n\n<p>Shipping over the rail is arguably the most earth-friendly way to get your cargo from point A to point B. One ton of freight can travel over 400 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That&rsquo;s over three times more fuel efficient than a truck!<\/p>\n\n<p>Trinity offers intermodal shipping to customers whenever possible, not just because it&rsquo;s a great alternative to truckload shipping in many cases, but also to reduce our (and our customers&rsquo;) carbon footprint. And according to the American Association of Railroads, moving freight by rail instead of over the road reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Responsible Care Certified<\/h2>\n\n<p>Responsible Care is an American Chemistry Council initiative dedicated to improving safety and sustainability in the chemical industry. Since a significant portion of our customers are large chemical manufacturers and distributors, we recognize the importance of upholding these strict standards, which help protect the earth and the people who work in these industries. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve held this rigorous certification since 2009.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Responsible Care guidelines that we are committed to following are compliance, sustainability, continual improvement, and openness. Essentially, this means that we manage our business activities to meet the requirements of all applicable chemical and hazmat laws, conduct our business in a way that sustains the health and well-being of our team members, regularly evaluate environmental, health, safety, and security performance, and encourage and seek constructive dialogue with stakeholders.<\/p>\n\n<p>Being eco-friendly isn&rsquo;t just about recycling anymore, and at Trinity, we realize that the transportation industry holds a great responsibility to positively contribute to our planet&rsquo;s health. This is why we believe in cutting down on fuel usage and emissions as much as we can, following industry best practices when servicing the chemical and hazmat industries, and using more efficient shipping modes whenever it&rsquo;s possible.<\/p>\n\n<p>If your company has a focus on eco-friendly business practices, Trinity could be a great partner for you. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/get-a-quote\">Click here<\/a> to get in touch with us and receive more information.<\/p>"}, {"ID":"633","cat_name":"Press Releases","title":"Trinity Logistics Named to Transport Topics' Top Brokerage Firms List for 14th Consecutive Year","url_title":"trinity-logistics-named-to-transport-topics-top-brokerage-firms-list-for-14","entry_date":"1461702960","exerpt":"Trinity Logistics has been named to Transport Topics Magazine\u2019s Top Brokerage Firms list for the 14th time.

Here are the basics you should be aware of. ","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}AprilNews.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 200px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<h2>1. SOLAS Regulation<\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">The international Maritime Organization&rsquo;s Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) regulation has reached the final stage of the rulemaking process. This new regulation, effective July 1, 2016, requires all shipping containers leaving from any port across the world to be accompanied by a shipping document signed electronically or physically by the shipper on the bill of lading.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">This document must have the verified gross mass (VGM) of the container in order to be loaded onto a ship. The VGM must be weighed by one of the approved methods, one of which is a scale calibrated and certified to the national standards of the country where the container is being weighed.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Currently, the consequences of not having this VGM document or the enforcement policy have not been finalized. However, many ports have already made it clear that they are not offering weighing services, which puts the sole responsibility back on the shipper.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">2. FDA&rsquo;s Final Rule on Safe Transportation of Food Rule<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">There&rsquo;s been some buzz in the industry about the FDA&rsquo;s new rules regarding food safety during transit.&nbsp; There was talk of a new rule that could shake up the industry quite a bit, and that has finally come to fruition.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">As of April 6, 2016, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released the Final Rule for the Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food.&nbsp; The aim of this new rule is to further protect food from contamination from farm to table. This means there are a new set of requirements for all shippers, receivers, 3PLs, loaders, and carriers who transport food in the United States by motor or rail vehicle.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Some of the key requirements noted by the FDA are that all vehicles and transportation equipment involved in the transit of food must be sanitary and able to be cleaned, as well as be able to maintain a temperature that is safe for the food they are hauling. Also, responsible parties will be held accountable for keeping ready-to-eat food from touching raw food, protection from contamination from a previous load of food, and cross-contact that could aid in spreading a food-borne illness. In addition, carriers will now be formally responsible for receiving training in safe food transport, as well as keeping the associated records.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>Depending upon the size and role of the business, compliance dates vary. The earliest compliance dates begin on April 6, 2017, while those deemed as small businesses have until April 6, 2018 to comply.<\/p>\n\n<p>To learn more about waivers and exemptions to this rule and compliance dates, visit the FDA&rsquo;s website.<\/p>\n\n<h2>3. New Senate Bill Addresses 34-Hour Restart Rule<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you read our February news update, you may remember the 34-hour restart rule had been suddenly removed from legislation, an action that appeared to be accidental. The ruling, which requires commercial motor vehicle drivers to take an off-duty rest that includes two 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. periods within 34 consecutive hours, is back on the map with the Senate&rsquo;s new bill.<\/p>\n\n<p>This new bill, the 2017 FY Transportation and Housing and Urban Development funding bill, makes it known that the restart rule will be in full effect if the Department of Transportation&rsquo;s (DOT) study on the pre-2013 restart period shows that these restart hours make for safer roadways. If the 34-hour restart rule does go back into effect, there will also be a new set of regulations to go along with it. One of the most notable would be that there would be a 73-hour work week cap on the consecutive amount of time a driver can be on duty in any seven-day period after making use of the 34-hour restart.<\/p>\n\n<p>If the DOT&rsquo;s study shows that the 2013 restart rules are safer, then those regulations would go back into effect. This means that truckers could use a 34-hour rest period to restart their week, but they would have to have at least two 1 a.m. to 5 p.m. periods in that restart. This specified restart would only be allowed once a week. This rule set would not include a 73-hour cap.<\/p>\n\n<p>This bill noting the possible scenarios made final by the outcome of the DOT&rsquo;s study on driver fatigue and hours of service, has been passed in the Senate, but will still need to be passed by the full Senate, not just the committee, as well as the U.S. House.<\/p>\n\n<p>We will update you as more information becomes available about each of these hot topics.

Here are some of the most popular misunderstandings.","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}LTLMYTHS.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 200px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>As with many things, there are some common misconceptions out there about less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping. If you fall victim to these myths, you could end up spending extra time or money when shipping LTL freight. Here are some of the most popular misunderstandings.<\/p>\n\n<h2>1. &ldquo;All LTL carriers calculate accessorial charges the same way.&rdquo;<\/h2>\n\n<p>In reality, accessorial charges can fluctuate between carriers by as much as 50%.&nbsp; To determine the fees charged by a specific carrier, you can look at their rules tariff.&nbsp; This will give you a breakdown of all the accessorials. Some of the most common accessorial charges include liftgate, residential delivery, hazardous material fee, and limited access charges.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>One reason these charges can vary between carriers is based on whether they calculate the fee based on cents-per-hundred-pounds, or by a flat rate.&nbsp; Working with a third-party logistics company (3PL) who has negotiated these rates to be more favorable for their customers can save shippers hundreds of dollars.<\/p>\n\n<h2>2. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been shipping the same freight for years, and my class has never changed, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it changing in the future.&rdquo;<\/h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to always double check occasionally to confirm your freight class hasn&rsquo;t changed, and if you work with a reputable 3PL, they will be able to advise you if a change to your freight class occurs. The NMFC (National Motor Freight Classification) board meets twice a year and revises the freight classes for dozens of different commodities, so there&rsquo;s always a chance that your freight class could change with no warning.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to this, the NMFC system is slowly adopting density as the primary method for determining class.&nbsp; Many commodities are currently being switched to density-based classifications. &nbsp;In the newly released NMFC book, there are over 300 products whose freight classes are determined by density.&nbsp; As a result of these changes, LTL carriers are being even stricter about accurate classifications being written on the bill of lading (BOL).<\/p>\n\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;ve never had issues with re-classifications in the past, it is likely you will be seeing carriers inspect all freight for changes.&nbsp; Carriers are equipping their drivers with tape measures and scanning devices to determine dimensions with the click of a button.&nbsp; As a result, shippers across the country are seeing an increase in class changes to their freight.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re not certain about which class to use, contact our LTL team and we&rsquo;ll be happy to assist you in determining the exact classification for your freight.<\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">3. &ldquo;LTL transit times are guaranteed.

It&rsquo;s imperative that the delivery time be listed clearly on the BOL, if they are able to offer that service.&nbsp; Some of the more common special options offered to customers are guaranteed delivery by noon, or by close of business (5 p.m.). This comes at an additional fee.<\/p>\n\n<p>A guaranteed transit time only takes effect once the shipment is picked up from the shipper&rsquo;s address, and delays in pick-up will not be factored into that time.&nbsp; Transit time does not include the day of pickup, or weekends and holidays.<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.72em; font-weight: 700;\">4. &ldquo;I need to schedule my pick-up at least a day in advance.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>With LTL, you don&rsquo;t need to schedule your pick-up a day in advance.&nbsp; In fact, only a two hour window for pick-up in the afternoon is required.&nbsp; LTL carriers pick up freight in the afternoon and deliver freight in the morning.&nbsp; It does, however, help LTL carriers plan their day if you schedule your freight to be picked up early in the morning instead of later in the day.&nbsp; Keep in mind, pick-ups are not guaranteed.<\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">5. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a fantastic discount with my current LTL carrier, so I&rsquo;m not interested in considering a different carrier or 3PL.&rdquo;<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p>When thinking about LTL pricing, keep in mind that base rates are a much more important factor to consider than the discount.&nbsp; You may have an 80% discount, but if the base rate is from 2016 and the one that a different provider uses is from 1996, you would still save money by switching.&nbsp; At Trinity, we have negotiated rates with LTL carriers that keep our base rates low. See the cost breakdown below:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Trinity example rate:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>$585.06 (base rate) &ndash; $468.05 (80% discount) + $54.93 (fuel) = $171.99<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>ABC Company example rate:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>$813.60 (base rate) &ndash; $650.88 (80% discount) + $54.93 (fuel) = $217.65<\/p>\n\n<p>In this instance, even with the same percentage discount, switching to Trinity would save you over 25%.<\/p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, too, that LTL service is about more than just rates. If you experience many service failures or frequent lapses in communication with your LTL provider, switching to a best-in-class 3PL with top notch LTL service can save you additional time and money, even if the rates are the same as before.<\/p>\n\n<p>To get an LTL quote or request more information about shipping LTL, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/get-a-quote\">click here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"641","cat_name":"Truckload","title":"CVSA International Roadcheck 2016: Be Prepared","url_title":"cvsa-international-roadcheck-2016-be-prepared","entry_date":"1464115260","exerpt":"This year\u2019s annual Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) International Roadcheck is scheduled for Tuesday, June 7 through Thursday, June 9 in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Carriers and shippers alike should be prepared for delays caused by this yearly safety check. ","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}roadcheck.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 200px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>This year&rsquo;s annual Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) International Roadcheck is scheduled for Tuesday, June 7 through Thursday, June 9 in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Carriers and shippers alike should be prepared for delays caused by this yearly safety check.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is the Roadcheck?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The CVSA conducts the largest targeted enforcement program on commercial vehicles in the world.&nbsp; Officially called the International Roadcheck, the program is in its 29th year of running roadside inspections to assess trucks, trailers, and drivers for compliancy on a variety of laws and regulations, ranging from hours of service, vehicle violations, and load security.<\/p>\n\n<p>To give you an idea of how vast this event is, the CVSA claims that it inspects an average of 17 commercial trucks every minute during the Roadcheck.<\/p>\n\n<h2>2015 Results<\/h2>\n\n<p>Last year, the CVSA estimated that over 10,000 CVSA and FMCSA inspectors worked at around 2,500 fixed and temporary inspection locations.&nbsp; This translated to about 1,020 vehicles being inspected every hour. Inspectors issued thousands of violations for a variety of issues including seatbelts, cargo securement, hazmat equipment, tires, and loose tie-downs.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How can I be prepared as a carrier?<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a carrier, you should make yourself aware of the inspection process in order to be in full compliance and get through a possible inspection as quickly as possible to avoid delays. According to the CVSA, here&rsquo;s what you can expect an inspector to look for during a Roadcheck inspection:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The driver&rsquo;s credentials (license, medical certificates)<\/li>\n\t<li>The driver&rsquo;s hours of service (HOS) log<\/li>\n\t<li>The carrier&rsquo;s credentials (lease agreements, markings, etc.)<\/li>\n\t<li>Shipping papers for loads<\/li>\n\t<li>The driver&rsquo;s condition (impaired, fatigued, cannot speak English, etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>How can I be prepared as a shipper?<\/h2>\n\n<p>As a shipper, you need to be aware of the impacts the Roadcheck can have on the transportation industry. Because many trucks actually decide to stay off the road completely during the Roadcheck, this can affect the time and money required to keep your supply chain moving. Some of the challenges you should be prepared for during Roadcheck are:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Possible increase in shipment transit time<\/li>\n\t<li>Lengthy tractor trailer inspections throughout North America<\/li>\n\t<li>Temporary drop in tractor trailer capacity<\/li>\n\t<li>Major rate spike in the spot market<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Luckily, the International Roadcheck is just an annual phenomenon, so these shipping delays and capacity challenges are only temporary and will resolve after June 9. However, now is the time to get your transportation plan prepared as a shipper, and your equipment and documents in order if you&rsquo;re a carrier.<\/p>\n\n<p>Contact your trusted Trinity advisor for more information on the Roadcheck or to help you develop a game plan to avoid any potential problems.

A sleep routine is key.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>We realize that having an exact sleep schedule might not always be doable week to week, or even day to day, depending on the shipments you might be hauling. However, there are still some simple steps you can take to prepare your body for a restful sleep.<\/p>\n\n<p>Try these time-tested strategies before you get some shut eye:<\/p>\n\n<p>Stop drinking caffeine at least 6 hours before bed<br \/>\nStop eating, especially large meals, at least 2 hours before bed<br \/>\nTurn off all electronics and bright lights at least an hour before bed<\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">2. Enjoy the area around you.<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p>Some shipping lanes can bring you to and through some of the most beautiful places the U.S. has to offer. When your breaks come up, plan out some time to enjoy a walk or jog through the local towns or parks. Enjoying the natural beauty of the surrounding areas around you can help get you out of the cab and make your shipment feel more like a road trip.<\/p>\n\n<h2>3. Make friends or adopt a furry companion.<\/h2>\n\n<p>As some truck drivers told us, having friends on the road can be really crucial for mental health. If you make new trucker friends, or have friends that live somewhere along your route, schedule a time to meet up for a meal, or to just hang out. This can boost your mood and feel like a break from the long drive ahead of you.<\/p>\n\n<p>If human friends aren&rsquo;t your thing, consider adopting a dog or cat, if you are prepared for the responsibility. We&rsquo;ve talked to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/blog\/pets-riding-shotgun-truckers-pets-on-the-road\">plenty of truckers<\/a> who have pets that ride shotgun with them. They keep them company, give them a reason to get outside, and just make the drive more enjoyable.<\/p>\n\n<h2>4. If you have to dine out, cruise the salad bar.<\/h2>\n\n<p>While preparing food yourself is the best option for healthy meals, it&rsquo;s not always the most realistic option when you&rsquo;re driving. Check out restaurants near your route that offer salad bars and fresh options.<\/p>\n\n<p>Often, salad bars also include cold prepared salads and other sides, so you won&rsquo;t just be stuck with a plate full of greens. Eating a burger and fries isn&rsquo;t the obvious choice when trying to be healthier, but if you do have to go that route, try getting the smaller burger and swapping the fries for a salad.<\/p>\n\n<h2>5. Keep in contact with friends and family on a daily basis.<\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">This tip came straight from a truck driver. It makes sense to stay connected to those at home, as it may help to feel like the distance between you is just a little less. This can also be your &ldquo;something to look forward to&rdquo; in the day and help you develop a routine.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Don&rsquo;t forget you can still be involved in events going on at home with Skype and Facetime. Seeing your loved ones&rsquo; faces can make the time pass just a bit faster and boost your mood.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">While these tips aren&rsquo;t sure guarantees for healthy bodies and minds, they are a good start. Your physical and mental health should be number one while you&rsquo;re on the road, especially on long hauls.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">To learn more about joining Trinity&rsquo;s carrier network, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/become-a-carrier\">click here<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><em><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Please note that Trinity Logistics is not authorized to provide medical advice.

Let\u2019s go over the basics so you can prepare accordingly.","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}fMSA.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 200px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>On April 6, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published the Final Rule for the Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food, part of the larger Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).&nbsp; If you manufacture, sell, handle, or transport food, keep reading. This ruling could have an impact on the way you do business, whether you&rsquo;re a shipper, receiver, or carrier. Let&rsquo;s go over the basics so you can prepare accordingly.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is the Final Rule for the Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food?<\/h2>\n\n<p>This is a government sanctioned ruling that applies to shippers, carriers, and receivers handling the transportation of food products in the United States. The aim of this new rule is to further protect food from contamination from farm to table, therefore minimizing food borne illnesses such as listeria and E.coli. This means there are a new set of requirements for all shippers, receivers, 3PLs, loaders, and carriers who transport food within the United States by motor or rail vehicle.<\/p>\n\n<h2>When do I need to begin complying with this rule?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The final rule is officially in effect, but depending on the size of your business, the compliance dates vary. According to the FDA, most businesses are required to be in compliance by April 6, 2017, which is one year from the rule&rsquo;s publication date of April 6, 2016. The only exception is for companies considered to be small businesses, who have until April 6, 2018 to comply. If your company employs less than 500 people, you are considered a small business in terms of this ruling, unless you are a motor carrier. For motor carriers, having less than $27.5 million in annual receipts classifies you as a small business.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Are there any businesses that are exempt from the ruling?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Some farms are exempt. Farms averaging less than $500,000 per year in food sales within the last three years, with the sales to qualified end-users (consumer of food, or local restaurant) exceeding all others, are considered exempt from the ruling. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, shippers, receivers, or carriers that have less than $500,000 in average annual revenue are exempt from the rule.<\/p>\n\n<p>Here is a breakdown of various ways the ruling may impact you, based on your role in the food supply chain. Keep in mind these points are not an exhaustive list of all the ways this complex ruling could change your processes. You should review the final rule on the FDA website for a complete explanation of the policies.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is expected of shippers?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Under the FSMA, shippers are considered to be a person, manufacturer, or freight broker who arranges for transportation of food in the US by a carrier or multiple carriers sequentially. &nbsp;Shippers are held responsible to ensure that vehicles and equipment are in sanitary conditions deemed acceptable by the FDA, specifying temperature and pre-cooling requirements in writing to the carrier, and ensuring that their cargo doesn&rsquo;t make food unsafe for bulk shipments.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is expected of loaders?<\/h2>\n\n<p>A loader is considered to be the person or party that loads food freight onto rail containers or motor vehicles. &nbsp;Loaders must determine if the vehicle and equipment are in appropriate sanitary condition before they load food product. They also must verify that all refrigerated and cold storage equipment is in working condition and at the proper temperature for the freight to remain safe.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is expected of carriers?<\/h2>\n\n<p>A carrier, the party physically moving food by rail or motor vehicle, has different expectations. &nbsp;They must develop and implement written procedures for cleaning, sanitizing, and inspecting their equipment. They must also determine that the vehicle and equipment are in acceptable sanitary conditions and the refrigerated cold storage is properly working and set at the right temperature for the freight before loading (pre-cooled).<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition, carriers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicles and equipment meet the shipper&rsquo;s specifications for the particular shipment and are able to maintain the temperatures needed to keep food safe. &nbsp;This agreement, if in writing, holds the carrier responsible for sanitary conditions while the freight is in transit, and therefore, the carrier must provide proper training to all persons handling the freight throughout its transportation.<\/p>\n\n<p>In order to help eliminate any potential accusations that a carrier may be at fault for damaged or unsafe food product, the carrier needs to maintain records and proof of equipment cleaning for all cargo that has been on their equipment for at least twelve months prior. All training records must also be kept and available for twelve months.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What is expected of receivers?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Receivers, or the persons receiving the food shipments, have their own requirements as well in this new food safety rule. &nbsp;Upon receipt of a food load, a receiver must verify that the product is at the safe temperature outlined by the shipper, and it is not tampered with. The FDA calls improper maintenance of temperature &ldquo;temperature abuse&rdquo;, and all product should be checked for signs of this. The receiver must also take proper measures to ensure that any damaged or unsafe food is not distributed for consumption.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What are the regulations that apply to all parties (shippers, loaders, carriers, and receivers)?<\/h2>\n\n<p>All parties involved in the transportation of food product, including shippers, loaders, carriers, and receivers, are responsible for a few aspects of the ruling. Essentially, if any of these parties are alerted of any possibility that food cargo may have been contaminated due to unsanitary conditions or improperly maintained temperatures, they must take the appropriate action necessary to halt the distribution of the food for consumption. Also, each party must maintain the relevant records for each food shipment, which might include the bill of lading (BOL), the shipper&rsquo;s shipping requirements, training records for carriers, and any other related documentation in the event that the FDA requests it.<\/p>\n\n<p>As with any new regulation, the FSMA is complicated and leaves some areas fuzzy and up for interpretation. If any of this information is unclear, or you have further questions, we encourage you to visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/Food\/GuidanceRegulation\/FSMA\/ucm334115.htm\">FDA&rsquo;s website <\/a>and read the published ruling.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rest assured that your trusted Trinity advisor is being trained and educated on these new set of rules and regulations. They will be able to help you manage your shipments to follow the FDA&rsquo;s new standards.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not already a customer, and you&rsquo;re interested in working with Trinity for your produce, refrigerated, or packaged food shipments, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/get-a-quote\">click here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"651","cat_name":"Carriers","title":"June ROAD Warrior Winners","url_title":"june-road-warrior-winners","entry_date":"1465834680","exerpt":"We value our exceptional carriers that help keep our freight moving, and in order to recognize them, we created the Trinity ROAD Warrior program.

This goes into effect in December 2016. In summary, the salary threshold that makes workers eligible for overtime pay when working more than 40 hours a week is rising from $23,660 to $47,476.<\/p>\n\n<p>This rise in the pay threshold means more people are eligible for the time-and-a-half pay. If you make less than $47,476 and work 40 or more hours a week at a salaried pay, you&rsquo;re eligible. According to Obama, this change makes an additional 4.2 million American workers eligible for overtime.<\/p>\n\n<p>While this bump in pay for over-timers might seem like an awesome advancement, it&rsquo;s important to consider what this will mean for employers in the transportation industry. Some trucking groups, like the National Automobile Dealers Association, claim that this new ruling would eliminate promotion potential for workers and ultimately eliminate jobs, since employees would cost more to keep.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Plans for Federal Road Funding<\/h2>\n\n<p>Funding for roads and transportation has been a bit of a mess the past few years. Many federally funded roadways and bridges are deteriorating at rapid rates, but there hasn&rsquo;t been funding to back their construction. This could all change in the next few years.<\/p>\n\n<p>Members of Congress have recently said that they are pushing to create a long-term funding system for infrastructure projects. &nbsp;In fact, there have been talks of increasing tolls and fuel taxes. Funds raised from these taxes would go back into the bridges and roads in need of repair. So, be on the lookout in the future for potentially increased tolls, which would lead to increased shipping costs as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to look at some options, and everything&rsquo;s on the table,&rdquo; said Rep.

Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of what the freight claims process entails here at Trinity.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What are the steps involved with filing a claim?<\/h2>\n\n<p>To file a freight claim as a Trinity customer, follow these important steps:<\/p>\n\n<p>1. Complete a claim form and submit it along with the required documents to your Trinity representative. The cargo claims form is the legal document that authorizes Trinity to file the claim with the carrier on your behalf. In addition to the claim form, invoices are required to support claim amounts.<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n2. Once we are presented with the freight claims form, proof of cost invoice, and other pertinent documents (like the BOL), we will report the claim to the assigned carrier. We field carrier responses and take care of the behind-the-scenes details for you.<\/p>\n\n<p>A carrier is given 30 days to legally acknowledge a claim and 120 days to give disposition (accept or refute the claim). At Trinity, we endeavor to resolve all claims within 120 days from filing.<\/p>\n\n<p>If a claim involves the carrier&rsquo;s insurance, we&rsquo;ll coordinate with the insurance adjuster to provide documents and information at their request. &nbsp;For approved claims, a check will be issued to you from Trinity or directly from the carrier or their insurer.<\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Why should you work with a shipping company that offers claims help?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p>While most shipments go off without a hitch, anyone in the shipping industry knows that sometimes &ldquo;stuff happens&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s a real lifesaver to have a team of professionals to take the stress out of the claims process. Working with a company that provides cargo claims support is far more convenient for you in the event that something unexpected happens in transit.<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Trinity initiates the claims process with the carrier and monitors progress until a resolution is met. We are a buffer between the cargo owner, carrier, and their insurer. Without our assistance, the cargo owner would have to contact the carrier directly to engage the freight claims process.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">This is especially evident in accident situations. If a carrier has an accident, our team expedites service to track the location of the cargo and attempts to prevent further delay or loss. We maintain communication with the account manager, driver, and other pertinent parties to meet the best resolution for our customer in the event of a loss.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Trinity maintains a network of trusted carriers that works with us to get situations resolved quickly in order to maintain our business relationship. Carriers may not be as responsive when dealing directly with the cargo owner in the event of a claim.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">How would the process work if I had to file a freight claim on my own without the help of a claims department?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">If you had to file a claim on your own, you would need to provide written notice of loss to the assigned carrier. You&rsquo;d also need to submit all documents requested by the carrier for processing. You would be responsible for breaking down cargo claim charges and convincing the carrier to accept liability. Arguments and rebuttals presented by the carrier would also need to be responded to directly by you.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">Our claims team here at Trinity is trained and knowledgeable in current laws governing the freight claims process. Several of our team members are even accredited as &ldquo;Certified Claims Professionals&rdquo;, which makes them uniquely qualified to handle cargo claims on behalf of our customers.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.45;\">If you have any questions regarding our claims team, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/ask-a-question\">click here.<\/a>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>"}, {"ID":"654","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"June Transportation News Update","url_title":"june-transportation-news-update","entry_date":"1467722040","exerpt":"June had some exciting news relating to the Panama Canal, CDL waivers for veterans, and the DOT's driver detention efforts. ","content":"<h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}junetransportation.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 200px;\" \/><\/h2>\n\n<h2>CDL Skills Test Waived for Vets<\/h2>\n\n<p>U.S. Veterans who are interested in transitioning to a civilian commercial driving job now have a little more flexibility to do so without taking the CDL skills test. The FMCSA recently announced that military vets who drove commercial vehicles while they served will now have up to a year after their release from the military to get their CDLs without needing to take the skills test.<\/p>\n\n<p>Essentially, this means that the transition from military to civilian life could be a bit easier for those looking to get into trucking and other driving jobs. This waiver period before the recent update was only 90 days. The FMCSA realized this was just too short of a period for a vet to reasonably get their affairs in order as well as take care of their license when getting back on home turf.<\/p>\n\n<h2>DOT&rsquo;s Driver Detention Efforts in Collection Phase<\/h2>\n\n<p>The issue of detention time at shippers and receivers for truckers is under investigation by the Department of Transportation (DOT). Since the hours of service (HOS) regulations are in full effect, the DOT is also taking into consideration what role loading and unloading has on the times drivers are on the roadways in conjunction with their regulated hours of service.<\/p>\n\n<p>The DOT is now collecting data on the delays at loading and unloading docks to then relate the possible effects it has on drivers and their burden to comply with the hours of service regulations. A concern the DOT wishes to explore is the possibility of drivers rushing to get to their appointment times after being delayed at a dock and the accidents and injuries that may follow. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The data collected in this study will be used to adjust or create new regulations to allow for the safety of not only drivers to be taken into consideration, but also those they share the roadways with. One possible outcome could be mandatory detention pay for those drivers delayed at a shipper or receiver.<\/p>\n\n<h2>New Panama Canal Opens<\/h2>\n\n<p>If you didn&rsquo;t already know, there has been an ongoing project to expand the Panama Canal. This project was expected to be finished in 2014 for the Canal&rsquo;s 100th anniversary, but due to a more complex construction schedule and other setbacks, it just didn&rsquo;t happen.<\/p>\n\n<p>However, the Canal reopened on June 26 after nine years of construction. The new canal allows for ships up to 12,000 feet long and 160 feet wide to pass, versus the original 965 feet long and 106 feet.<\/p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s been forecasted that this new capacity in Panama may lead to changes in U.S. freight patterns, specifically, shipping containers moving from West Coast ports to East Coast ports. Meaning, shipments on the rail and long-haul trucking volume may diminish, but there may be more activity on the U.S.&rsquo;s East Coast.&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"657","cat_name":"Logistics","title":"Humans vs. Robots: Why the Human Touch isn't Dead","url_title":"humans-vs.-robots-why-the-human-touch-isnt-dead","entry_date":"1468416540","exerpt":"Robots and automated systems are great for vacuuming houses, data entry, and car washes, but some things are just better left to humans.

","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}robot.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 200px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>Robots and automated systems are great for vacuuming houses, data entry, and car washes, but some things are just better left to humans. Here&rsquo;s why robots just can&rsquo;t replace the human connection in regards to customer service and freight shipping quotes.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Customer Service<\/h2>\n\n<p>Have you ever called an automated phone service, which is meant to speed up a process, only to repeat all of your answers multiple times and be connected to a representative who asks you to repeat everything you told the robot? Frustrating, huh?<\/p>\n\n<p>One aspect of business that a robot simply should not attempt to overtake is customer service. An automated system isn&rsquo;t capable of understanding tone or emotion, or expressing empathy; all qualities that a good customer service rep should have. That robot isn&rsquo;t going to understand the severity of your need, that your livelihood depends on your call being answered and solved, or the complexity of any issues you&rsquo;re having.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the battle between robots and humans, humans still win in this category. After all, who wants to call in to get help with their account or a shipment, explain the entire situation, only to have a robot say, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get that, please press 2&rdquo;?<\/p>\n\n<h2>Freight Shipping Quote<\/h2>\n\n<p>While some 3PLs boast an automated system that can spit a shipping quote back to you within just a few minutes, or even instantaneously, this might not actually be a service that&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be. While it may be easier to communicate all of the details about the shipment including the origin and destination, weight, and commodity, it&rsquo;s not as easy to establish a relationship with the actual human being that will be handling not only your quote, but your account moving forward.<\/p>\n\n<p>Trinity is a company that still values relationships. While we don&rsquo;t have an automated quote form on our website that can deliver a freight shipping quote immediately, we have dedicated sales representatives on standby to answer the phone calls and emails of anyone in need.<\/p>\n\n<p>We believe that talking to an actual person can help us get to know our customers, their businesses, and needs better. The better we know a customer, the better we can serve them by offering other relevant services and the most cost-efficient methods of shipping their freight.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sure, a form can ask where your business is located, but a person on the other end of the line might have grown up in the same area, know it like the back of their hand, and be able to figure out the best way to route your shipments. An online form might compute a shipping quote based off the commodity, but an account manager that&rsquo;s been handling your shipments for years might be able to negotiate contracted rates based off of the volume of shipments you have throughout the year.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The Bottom Line<\/h2>\n\n<p>The bottom line here is that robots are awesome for some aspects of business, and even the transportation industry benefits from ideas like self-driving trucks and automated warehousing robots. However, some parts of the business world should be left to the human touch. At Trinity, we place high value in speaking directly with each of our customers and carriers and establishing a working relationship that can withstand the ebbs and flows of business, economy, and life.<\/p>\n\n<p>To speak to a trusted Trinity adviser, click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trinitylogistics.com\/get-a-quote\">here<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>"}, {"ID":"658","cat_name":"Press Releases","title":"Ribbon Cutting Ceremony Held for Trinity Logistics' New Iowa Regional Service Center","url_title":"ribbon-cutting-ceremony-held-for-trinity-logistics-new-iowa-regional-servic","entry_date":"1468860240","exerpt":"We recently celebrated the opening of a larger office for its Regional Service Center in Denison, Iowa with a ribbon cutting ceremony.","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"{filedir_3}cmyk_DSCN6187.jpg\" style=\"width: 610px; height: 300px;\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>We celebrated the opening of a larger office for our Regional Service Center in Denison, Iowa with a ribbon cutting ceremony on Wednesday, July 13. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>We are proud to have served the Iowa region for more than 13 years.
